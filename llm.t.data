I dont think I could have survived these last few years without the meditation and meditative State of Consciousness is a natural stay but we just forget how to get there and I think we just underestimate the the power of the Mind the body and mind aren't separate we let go we put down our baggage from the past we let go of our expectations for the future and in that moment we're free greetings friends and welcome to the ritual podcast today I'm delighted to share with you a very special compilation episode dedicated to the wondrous world of meditation meditation is an ancient practice that has been around for Millennia with roots in a wide diversity of traditions from all around the globe and while the benefits of meditation are vast and varied the most fundamental is its ability to better understand the nature of mind the nature of Consciousness and cultivate within us a sense of Peace Clarity and focus all of the various forms of meditation from breath awareness and body scanning to mindfulness loving kindness opposana transcendental and many other guided and unguided variations are all engineered to help us achieve a release and a reprieve from the complexities of our mind and our world in the fast-paced hyper-connected world that we live in people often struggle to find the time or the motivation to meditate and it does require investment meditation is not a quick fix or a magic pill but meditation also should not be a burden it can be a way of life that seamlessly integrates into our daily routine in a world where we are inundated with ceaseless distractions and an endless flow of information meditation serves as a powerful antidote tool to reconnect with our true selves and unlock our greatest potential that's why I'm excited to bring you this compilation featuring some of the most inspiring and enlightening discussions we've had with experts in the field of meditation from learning how to cultivate a daily practice to exploring the Neuroscience behind the benefits of meditation this episode is packed with valuable insights and practical advice so whether you're an experienced meditator or someone who has never even considered the practice before I think you'll find something of value in the discussions to come starting with a clip from my conversation with Yuval Noah Harari Yuval is a prodigious intellect truly one of the great thinkers of our time and the author of The Landmark book sapiens which is the utterly fascinating Narrative of Humanity's Origins and evolution it is an absolute must read in addition Yuval is a professor a coveted speaker a lecturer and the author of two other seminal works homodeus and 21 lessons for the 21st century in this clip eval explains how meditation has been crucial to his work how it has helped him cultivate a deep understanding of the human mind and behavior and how to one degree or another we are slaves to our mind and the narratives that often Loop incessantly our external and internal worlds often Collide in ways that distort reality our perception is often ping-ponging between fantasy and actuality we are not as in control of our hyperactive mind as we think we are and in my far-ranging conversation with Yuval in episode 392 one in which I encourage all of you to hear the entirety of Evol presents meditation as not only a way of recognizing that truth but also as the best tool for correcting it so sit back relax take a deep breath and join us on this journey of self-discovery and inner exploration as we begin this master class on meditation with Yuval Noah Harari I don't think I could have survived these last few years without the meditation uh you know all the publication of the book and all the attention and traveling around the world um without a peace of mind uh that the meditation brings I could not have done it I couldn't have written the book in the first place without the meditation because as you said it brings a kind of clarity and focus especially if you try to condense the entire history of the world into like 450 Pages which is very ambitious yes unique it gives you it gave you this incredible objectivity though to see everything from ten thousand feet yeah um but you need to be able to focus because there are so many details that can take you here and there and then you end up writing 4 000 pages and not 400 pages um but but really for me the most important uh contribution of meditation is to to really be able to see reality as it is and to tell the difference between what is really happening and what is just stories generated by the mind the human mind you can pull your your smartphone out and the algorithm would tell you this is the one thing that so far algorithms are not getting even close to telling you um that you know the human mind is a factory for the generating fictional stories about myself about my family about my country about the world and it's so difficult to tell the difference between the stories we invent and and and objective reality and I when I came to my first meditation with vitasana Retreat it was 18 years ago I was doing my PhD in Oxford and I thought it was a very smart person and that I Know Myself very well and I'm in control of my life and the teacher gave us the first uh few few days the practice is very very simple in in a way just observe your breath just observe when the breath is coming in be aware when it's coming in you know it's coming in when it's going out you just know it's going out you don't need to do anything not a breathing exercise you don't need to control the breath you just know now it's coming in it sounds like the simplest thing in the world and I was absolutely shocked that I couldn't do it for more than 10 seconds like I would try to just no is it coming in or out and within like five seconds the mind would run away to some memory some fantasy oh I forgot I needed to do this so I needed to do that and whatever and I I realized I know almost nothing about my mind I have absolutely no control over it we need to start from zero I mean and this was a name this I think it was the most important thing anybody ever told me in my life and it was the most shocking realization of of my life and uh also and transformative yeah very very transformative and from from then on both in my Prime my private life and also in my work I try to just stick with this very simple exercise just try to see what is really happening right now one of the fundamental truths that meditation forces us to Grapple with is that we are literally of two minds a thinking mind and in observing or witnessing mind so imagine a literal split between one part of ourselves that is constantly thinking and acting in a certain way and another part of the Mind in which we are simply observing ourselves thinking and acting and it's this very Act of observation that when engaged allows us to benefit from a non-judgmental aspect of our own mind rewarding us with Clarity over condemnation objectivity over obfuscation and witnessing over withholding but we live in the thinking mind more often than not we are neurologically set by default to a constant stream of automatic reactions based on prior experiences this thinking mind is constantly analyzing things trying to make sense of the world around us and to some extent it needs to do that for our survival but when it overrides the witnessing mind it can cause us to drift into completely fabricated versions of what is happening within us or to us propelling us into anxiety stress and even depression all of this is brought to light in our next clip by Charlie Knowles a Visionary Vedic meditation master and highly regarded teacher of meditation Charlie has developed a unique expertise in distilling seemingly Elusive and Arcane Vedic Traditions down to their Essence expressing some of the deepest Concepts from spirituality and Science in simple practical steps that are effective AIDS in finding inner peace and happiness this excerpt of my conversation with Charlie is from a very early recording in the history of this podcast episode 43 and my wife Julie makes an appearance you'll hear her share her perspective occasionally Julie was then and is today a much more advanced practitioner of meditation than I am and the conversation is all the better for having her experience enjoy there's an interesting thing that you know when I teach people to meditate um you know the stages people go through usually for most people they don't get it the first time you know that they it takes a few days for them to really kind of sink into the experience and find the joy in it um but once they do it's it's it's revelatory to it I mean they have this uh moment where they begin to go beyond the more surface level of their mind to their quieter levels of consciousness they find their thoughts begin to get quiet and disappear and they experience a more expansive aspect of their own Consciousness and almost every time that happens uh people will say you know what I I have experienced this before you know I've had this when I was a little kid it's always when they're a little kid so it's like when I was 10 or when I was 12 I just had this spontaneously happen to me where I felt like I was really connected to Nature and my mind was really open I felt this waves of bliss and joy a coursing through my body and I didn't really know what was happening I just kind of went with it and felt really like my mind was everywhere and nowhere at the same time and it just happened by itself and what that's convinced me is that the meditative State of Consciousness is a natural state but we just forget how to get there and that's that's the the key for me and the the you know kind of the role that I play is reminding people you know what there actually is a technique or a set of techniques that you can use to to just turn that switch in your brain and make that thing happen that thing that should be spontaneous that perhaps once was spontaneous for you to experience you know one of the things that I've talked about before on the podcast that I'd love to hear you kind of expound on a little bit more is this idea that uh you know we all walk around thinking that you know we are our mind and we are our thoughts and not really kind of understanding or really embracing this idea that our thinking mind and our higher state of consciousness are two different things and it seems weird and like hard to wrap your brain around that but you know a perfect example is and I'm sure everybody has had this Where You observe yourself doing something or thinking cert a certain thing and you have kind of an outsider's perspective on it like why am I you know saying this to this person and feeling this right now well there's all so there's this there's like this divide right this dichotomy between you know one part of you that is acting and thinking a certain way and another part of you that is observing that or placing a judgment on that or entertaining a different way of handling something yeah and a lot of meditation Traditions that's referred to as the Silent Witness so our witnessing experience where you can sort of stand back and observe your life going on and not feel as overwhelmed by all of the you know the conditions that normally suck you into it um the unfortunate thing is that they're going to learn oh that's not who you are actually you know that deeper level of you is not who you are you're actually you know now you're going to go to a school and you're a person who went to this school and you're going to get a job and you're going to be a person who does this job and you identify yourself over time more and more with you know if you ask someone who are you only and I came from Pensacola and I'm a plumber and right you know I went to this University and you know that this is who I'm married to and so on and uh there's a deeper level of yourself all that stuff's fine but it's not like anything that's bad it's just that there's a deeper level of you that people are they don't really know how to explore that or really know what that deeper aspect of themselves is beyond all of those surface levels of identity and that's really what meditation is it's learning to discover this sort of more boundless aspect of your Consciousness and your identity where you can you can just feel and you can rather than saying you know I am you know this job and this place and this school and so on just I am you know I'm here right I'm I'm I'm present and it's it's a perfectly it's perfect Stillness and perfect dynamism at the same time it's a lovely experience it's difficult to put into words actually because it's one of those things that kind of goes beyond language a little bit but everyone who's had it and you know they can all say oh yeah I am yeah yeah that thing yeah I read that completely it's much easier to teach someone how to actually do it than to explain it right the that's also another one of the big myths about meditation is that when you do it you're going to become this you know sort of uh you're going to lose yourself but I've never seen people who meditate all the time they become more of who they are you know you lose that layer of anxiety and stress and people identify with their stress you know especially in New York speaking of New York people I get people all the time or say you know there's like I'm an anxious New Yorker and I was like God that's a strange self-identity to have um you know people get people to identify like I'm an angry person you know I'm I'm an anxious person I can't sleep at night and they have all these ideas about who they are once you lose all of that you find out who you really are you know and it's um it's a lot more liberating to have uh have have your sense of self based on inner happiness and Bliss and you know when I speak about these kind of more far out experiences they'll happen every now and then you know it's not something that like happens every time I meditate or anytime someone meditates but every now and again they'll happen and that should be normal as well we should be able to talk about that and and be able to say you know that there's there's a way that you can understand these things if there's one sort of consistent theme with this podcast it's really about bringing a diversity of people to The Listener to empower them to create greater self-empowerment over your life right and there really isn't anything more powerful than developing a Mastery over your conscious self if you can master that or or at least take steps towards that Mastery then the kingdom is yours I mean really and if you're you know if you're stuck in life if you don't like your job if you if you're not sure you know who you are how you want to express yourself if you you know are feeling aimless or misguided or you know unanchored honestly like you know the greatest gift you could give to yourself is to begin some form of meditation practice with a technique that resonates with you exactly and you will develop a greater connection with who you are who you're meant to be at a very minimum you'll you'll be more expressive in your creativity you'll feel more grounded in who you are more comfortable in yourself more self-assured I mean there's really no limit yeah that's absolutely true there's a lot of books and starting to self-help books that'll tell you things like that like get beyond your story like read about it yeah and it's not going to work okay um how you know and uh you know or you know they'll say things like you know experience yourself as being Universal it's like well I'm here in a room I'm gonna be eating a singing witch so how you know and and that's really what the meditative process is is is direct experience rather than philosophy like I don't I've spent very little time when I'm teaching trying to convince people that oh yeah this is what you're going to have in fact I prefer to give them this technique and not say too much about it and let them come back to me and say wow I just kind of had this moment where I went beyond everything like yep that's an expected result you know and and and have them be the one that tells me about it and then confirm because it's uh it's it's really cool to see that spontaneously happen in every kind of person to like people come with all these different things and say you know I every single person who comes when they come to like an introductory talk or something they'll come up to me it's like I I can't do this there's no way that I I'm unique I'm the one person who's too stressed who's too Taipei who's two you know to to my mind is too busy I won't be able to everyone else can in recovery they call that terminally uh terminally exceptional right I love that that's a good job um and you know it's just like every single and then the next person comes and says the exact same story you know and it's it's like no you're just a human we've all got the same stuff inside our heads you know and so and we're all raised in a similar culture too you know it's we all have the same background assumptions and so um it's really fun to say like this these techniques that just work right you know the lineage of meditation teachings is ancient this is wisdom that has been passed down over Generations from teacher to student the lineage of meditation Masters is long it's illustrious and the ancient wisdom of the practice finds relevance in today's world as much as it did in times of distant past that relevance is broken down in our next clip with Andy pedicone a former Buddhist monk and co-founder of the wildly successful meditation app headspace and one of the objectives that Andy and his co-founder Rich Pearson set out to achieve with headspace was how to make meditation more accessible to the General Public in our culture meditation has a reputation for being mystical and esoteric but what if modern presenters could shift The Narrative away from the mystical and toward the Practical what if there is an unequivocal neurological benefit achieved with meditation that has been extensively studied and vastly reported on over the past several decades and what if those benefits weren't for the few but for the masses what meditation does for the brain is better understood today than it ever was and those benefits are numerous they're real they're significant specifically the science of neuroplasticity which has exploded over the last two decades this idea that we can literally rewire new synaptic connections create expanded Pathways and grow our brains has emerged as a scientific and cultural focal point and meditation in particular has been definitively shown to be a highly effective tool tool in reshaping the brain we now have significant evidence of the efficacy of meditation as both treatment and preventative care across a broad spectrum of maladies for more on this here is the uniquely authoritative Andy protocol the first thing I'd say is authenticity I'm a big believer in lineage and tradition doesn't matter whether it's meditation or if it's in learning to play the piano or surfing whatever it is if something gets passed down in a very personal way over never mind decades but if we start talking about hundreds of years or even Millennia like something really it's like a refinement and development that takes place which is really powerful I think so I learned from my teacher who learned from their teacher and that goes back a long long way and and I think a big part of this is a very kind of gradual approach right when you come to the come to the app you learn a day and you come back the next day and you're building on the day before so it's it's this step-by-step learning kind of process I think there's something very valuable in that in the past back in the 80s you buy a meditation CD or something and you just sit there and listen to the same thing every day so there's no real kind of development of the practice it's quite kind of static in a way so I think that's one thing I think what Rich the the co-founder um and my very good friend has brought to this project is a degree of creativity which has never really existed like if you look back at meditation it's fine for people who are interested in that kind of thing and don't mind images of lotus leaves and people sitting cross-legged under a waterfall with a sunset in the background but for most people that's not really kind of their thing you know and it's it's another barrier and Rich has this ability to create a whole kind of world a visual World which is immediately engaging which is non-threatening and which is very approachable so I think those things authenticity creativity and I'm going to add in a third one which is science have all helped bridge that Gap so if you look at the science in the last 20 years around meditation and mindfulness it's a it's astonishing you know like we in the past you simply there was no way of knowing what was happening to the brain so now we're not only talking about what happens to the mind but we're talking about the physiological impact on the brain itself and seeing that parts of the brain actually change not only in the amount of blood flow they get but they change in shape and size and strength depending on our meditation that's a it's an amazing thing it's a really compelling again invitation to practice I think right I mean it's it's really having a moment right now there is a Zeitgeist moment happening I mean you've devoted your life to this this is you know a long time coming but it's really convergence of popular culture with with your interest and your expertise and your authenticity to get to this place where now science is interested and we're looking at neuroplasticity and I think you I'd read or heard you say that mentioned that you know there's maybe three to five thousand peer-reviewed studies impact of meditation yeah um I mean that's crazy it's huge that many studies out there and it's happened so quickly like I mean the early studies kind of go back maybe 35 years but really sort of the ones involving fmri machines where we can actually see what's going on in the brain during meditation it's only in the last like 12 to 15 years so it's really kind of recent and but I do think that that's sped up kind of this acceptance of it yeah well it makes it palatable like oh well if that guy says so or you know exactly or you know and even in the corporate Partnerships that you guys are you know have done with Virgin Atlantic it sort of gives it this and perimeter of acceptability with the mainstream that allows people to to you know sort of embrace it a little more readily I think I think it just gives you that stamp of approval and people trust big Brands like virgin and they get on the plane and man virgin is saying it's okay I'll give it a go right right right well let's talk about the science and the benefits right let's talk about neuroplasticity let's talk about Focus all of these things I mean let's let's assume that that you know I'm a listener I'm listening to this and this is my first introduction to meditate I mean of course I've heard of meditation but you know I'm not convinced that this is something that I really need to spend any time on yeah so number one I would say I never tell anyone they should meditate I would just say from a scientific point of view look there are these research studies that have been done and in these research studies there have been many many benefits that have been discovered I would I would recommend that you have a look at those if you're inspired to try give it a go like base it on don't do it because someone else tells you to do it do it because you feel motivated to do it and then continue to do it because you recognize the benefit yourself in terms of the medicine internally they're not obviously with us in a recording studio today I would always defer we have a chief medical officer uh Dr David Cox and we also have a neuroscientist Claudia and both of them are far more Adept in talking about this stuff but as you mentioned earlier there are over 5000 papers peer-reviewed published studies showing that meditation mindfulness can help us with everything from reducing anxiety reducing depression and the relapse of depression decreasing the incidence of insomnia improving heart health decreasing our cholesterol levels all the way through to I mean this sort of suffering chronic pain there's increasing levels of empathy and sometimes you look at like the spread of this and it's like you know how is this even possible how can one thing like have this impact on so many different things and I think we just underestimate the the power of the Mind the body and mind aren't separate we know when we get stressed in the mind that we feel it we experience it in the body we know when we're really relaxed and happy we feel that in the body so it's maybe not such a surprise that we see these kind of benefits arise look at the amount of time energy and money spent on sort of taking care of other things that are less important yeah whether it's like you know shampoo for your hair or brushing your teeth speak for yourself yeah that's right right um you know what do we do to tend to our mental health well uh we oh I guess you know when we get home we pour ourselves a cocktail and we watch Dancing with the Stars and that's our that's our way of relaxing yeah watch a football game or something like that and that's not tending to you know that's not doing sort of mental push-ups not at all and this is you know there's different ways some people like it's interesting when I look at you know we work with professional sports people and sports teams and corporations and for them it's more about Focus productivity um and for them it is about it's like training their mind don't you say it's almost mental push-ups for a very specific person exactly right and then I think for I actually believe for a bigger demographic it's more like you know how can I sleep better at night how can I feel a little less stressed how can I have better relationships with those around me and those things they're huge make even a small shift in one of those areas in life and that is a life that's transformed right away I would love to see a shift I'd love to see a shift in terms of prevention so I think far too often in our society we wait until something happens until trying to kind of fix it and that's what the medication kind of thing is you know there's already a problem if we can get into a pattern in society whether it's ourselves the Next Generation preferably both where we're taking preventative care of the Mind where we're actually carving out prioritizing whether it's 10 15 minutes in a day whatever it might be to look after to clean the Mind each day we don't even need to get to the point where we have to decide whether to medicate or not like that's I think the potential that's beautifully put and and to me that's the future of medicine you know functional medicine preventive medicine you know in the physical yeah realm as well and it's no coincidence you know we have we have 54 research studies on the table right now 34 are in motion and these are all reverse engineered so these are hospitals clinics universities coming to us and saying we believe that mindfulness and meditation can be a meaningful intervention with these types of symptoms can we test it and we're seeing time and time again it makes a difference and the more the medical community Embrace that the more I think we'll see it move from right now it's being seen more of a treatment not management treatment but I think over time it will move from treatment to management to prevention you know so often words like freedom and Liberation are used around meditation I I or sometimes it can sound a bit kind of much to sort of Liberation but there is it's a sense of being liberated we we let go we put down our baggage from the past we let go of our expectations for the future and in that moment we're free like there is freedom and when we're not free like it's so it's almost self-imposed but we don't realize what it is we're doing that that is causing this sense of being constrained and then when we discover that sense of freedom I just think you know life is life has changed there is an opportunity for transformation right there because there is nobody who cannot meditate and what excites me about it is is that person hasn't yet found or hasn't yet been shown the way to approach it in such a way that they get to experience what they think it might be and so it's it's helping them find that that approach you know because thoughts are thoughts you know that that underlying sense of Stillness and calm is always with us it's not unique to one individual some people find it easier to let go of thoughts and experience that calm but everybody has the potential to do it some people experience it the moment they first sit down for others it can take a number of days for others it can take a number of weeks but helping people understand that it's not about switching off thoughts it's not about clearing the mind if that's the way you approach meditation then of course you're gonna feel terrible about it because it is the nature of the mind to think so if we can kind of flip down his head and say okay instead meditation is actually about how can we learn to step back out of the out of the traffic out of the stream of thought and simply be present then it doesn't matter actually if we can really feel confident and comfortable that doesn't matter if the mind is busy whether it's quiet so you have the busiest mind in the world and you're okay with it my teacher kind of used to sum it up like this he used to say there is no such thing as good or bad meditation there is only awareness or non-awareness and that's it you can't fail I love that as we've discussed the surface of the mind is a chaotic Rhapsody of ceaseless thoughts its Perpetual Nature has us often looping unhelpful or even hurtful thinking that distracts us from the present and creates an alternate reality for us to engage in but beneath the turbulent surface is a Transcendent Stillness of the mind that is a Wellspring of peacefulness and once accessed it recalibrates us to a more effulgent center of our being this is the foundation for the practice of TM or Transcendental Meditation which recognizes a vertical Dimension to our mind and looks to give us access to the more deeply felt and understood nature within us that is beyond thinking or Focus tm's original teacher was Maharishi Mahesh Yogi and his core modality is the chanting of a mantra the repetition of a single word or simple phrase Maharishi was originally a physicist who while still young shifted his professional Focus from science to that of serving his spiritual Masters after years of dedicated study Maharishi perfected his meditation methodology and announced to the world that he would teach and help popularize a type of meditation that could benefit everyone over the preceding decades TM has become a globally popular style of meditation and in my next excerpt you will hear me speak with one of tm's most popular Western teachers Bob Roth Roth is the CEO of the David Lynch Foundation and a director for the center of leadership performance over the past 50 years Roth has been dedicated to teaching a wide spectrum of students from disadvantaged inner city kids to military veterans to trauma victims a transcendental meditation practice consisting of two 20-minute sessions per day one in the morning and one in the evening orientates us toward an inward Direction without the application of effort it is essentially an intervention oriented around the implementation of self-care to expound further here is Bob Roth so perhaps this would be a good moment to just Define Transcendental Meditation in the context of that and what it is about that practice that allows you to enter that self-transcendent state so I like to use an example of an ocean where you're stuck you're in a little boat and you're stuck on the middle of the Pacific Ocean and you get these humongous waves 30 40 foot high waves and you could think the whole ocean is an upheaval but if you could do a cross section of the ocean out there you'd realize you got these little itty bitty 30-foot waves but the ocean in reality is over a mile deep and while the surface of the ocean may be turbulent the depth of the ocean is by its nature silent and that's analogous to the mind so the surface of the mind is this active thinking mind gotta gotta gotta monkey mind all that and every human being thinks that sometimes I'd like to have some inner calm some inner quiet some inner ease some inner silence some inner focus and the operative word there is inner and the question is is there such a thing as an inner and if so how do you get there so Rick when we talk about Transcendental Meditation as I said a moment ago we hypothesize because there's no belief there's no philosophy here the deep within you and your wife and every other person you know and everyone in the world right now there's a level of the Mind deep within a Transcendent level of the mind that is already calm quiet peaceful and yet the source of our creativity intelligence happiness and Transcendental Meditation gives effortless access to that how should I answer that yeah how because I'm thinking when you're describing the other uh the other methodology of kind of noticing your thoughts and being the dispassionate neutral Observer of the meanderings of the mind that that probably best describes my experience so what are we doing so in that in that it's a cognitive process it's it's attending and adjusting to you could say the waves so focused attention is stop the waves the the idea is that thoughts are on the surface you're on the surface and the same with this when you're stepping back and observing the thoughts or you're still on the surface in Transcendental Meditation we recognize or we identify that there's a vertical Dimension to the mind that we feel things deeply you love your wife deeply you don't want to do something profoundly there there's that there's that feeling of of uh sign an athlete you're an athlete there must be moments of the Zone sure that goes Way Beyond what's up here and there's just this pervasive silence and so that quiet calm that we access in during meditation Transcendental Meditation and I'll tell you how we do that efforts please do so other approaches to meditation see thoughts or the wandering mind as not the enemy but sort of the the uh obstacle to a calm mind so if you could control the mind it's a it's a monkey mind it just wanders and you've got to Reign it in or you've got to give more space between thoughts or and Maharishi Mahesh Yogi who was a physicist who became a great meditation teacher his Insight was the mind is not wandering aimlessly your mind is not just a monkey mind your mind is in search of something more satisfying you sit in a room and you listen to some wretched music and some beautiful music comes on in the other room your attention is drawn to that music you bring two books on vacation and one book is terrible and you can't read it another book is great absorbed in it for hours it is not people say well it's an acquired skill to meditate to do this mindfulness it's not an acquired skill to listen to the most beautiful music you've heard in your life it's not an acquired skill to see the most beautiful sunset you've ever seen in your life you're drawn to that and the idea or the hypothesis again I use that term is it inside of everyone in that Transcendent level of the mind is a field of satisfaction quiet Bliss peace happiness all the people have talked about it forever in Transcendental Meditation you learn how to give the attention I know this is abstract but you learn how to give the attention of the Mind in inward Direction like you want to teach a child how to dive you say honey stand like this bend over like that rest is automatic there's no forcing gravity takes over so when you learn TM from a teacher you learn how to just allow the attention of your mind to be drawn Inward and without any effort as a matter of fact any effort stops the process without any effort your mind is just gently settles down and when that happens then you have Alpha One brain waves completely different than mindfulness and I want to talk a little bit more of that some of the other brain research your body gains this deep state of rest cortisol levels are reduced and you feel rejuvenated do I think there's a role for other do I think TM is the only way of course not of course not you know as somebody whose life has been transformed by the 12 steps of which meditation is one my perspective as a member of that Community is that that step which involves meditation kind of gets the it kind of doesn't get the attention that it deserves it's part of it but the meditation there isn't really any kind of focus people don't know what to do yeah they can't do it so they do it for 60 seconds and no one tells them how to do it and so it doesn't really stick and so it doesn't really become an integral practice in that recovery equation for most people you wouldn't just if you had a physically I mean you wouldn't say well just go online and see what they tell me to do you know you go to an expert you go to a person who's a proper diagnostician who could um prescribe something that's proven and I think the same way is with mind we we shouldn't be so casual we should do research you know meditation there's a lot of hippie dippy stuff there's some cheap stuff but there's also some substantive stuff and learn from a teacher who knows what she or he is doing you know you have a certified teacher one of the big problems and I have a lot of friends in the mindfulness field and of Sharon salzberg was telling me that she said problem with mindfulness now is they lost their brand anybody can say they're doing whatever and so science doesn't know what it is if you do a mindfulness program at a school in Spokane what are you doing in same street yeah there's no control whereas with TM it's specific it's it's absolutely um uh precise and the training program is is high level of certification right and it involves doing 20 minutes of this practice twice a day yeah essentially once in the morning for 20 minutes you get up 20 minutes earlier and you um people say I'm not going to give up my time my sleep he said no no it's better than sleep it's deeper than sleep and then sometime in the afternoon or early evening before dinner so the morning is like rejuvenating and you have a high level of energy that takes you sustain to so you don't need multiple cups of coffee and that sort of thing and makes you more resilient and then you do it at the end of the day to sort of wash off the stresses of the day whatever you've picked up and be more present with your partner with what you're doing in the evening and sleep much better at night so traditionally for thousands of years it used to be done done at dawn and dusk but it was first thing morning and afternoon do you ever mess yeah of course yeah I mean I try not to well you're human most people say I don't have time or I don't know how I'm going to make the time but like myself like a good alcoholic I'm like well more must be better right when I was talking to Dan Harris he told me that he's experimenting right now with meditating two hours a day because he wants to just see you know like he wants to like he wants me to teach him to him yeah I would imagine that he would um just to see like what that what would happen if he does he must be interesting for his wife I was actually no I would now we can close but I was um actually talking to this businessman in in New York who was with his 12 year old son and uh they were sent by his wife was meditating and I think um the wife took the sun aside and gave him some tips on what to say so the husband was saying you know I'd like to learn how to do it I don't think I can do it because my mind is so busy but I don't have the time I just don't have the time 20 minutes do I sit down all the time so the kid said dad there's 1440 minutes in a day you don't have 40 minutes and then this is where the mom came in for self-care so and the fact is it has to be a priority the trade the trajectory the trajectory that we are all on as a society as a culture as individuals is not sustainable it's just not sustainable we're falling apart and so this is an intervention this is my own intervention I'm going to take 20 minutes from my morning find it get up earlier I'm going to take 20 minutes in the afternoon for myself and then the rest of the world will adjust and the nice thing about this is so many people who come say I could never close my eyes for two minutes much less 20. and because this meditation is so enjoyable the experience is so satisfying 20 minutes flies by just flies by and if people say well I do mindfulness or I do be passing I say we have to stop siloing oh I do this and therefore I don't do that there's many Tools in a toolbox and these three different approaches focused attention open monitoring mindfulness and transcending they have different outcomes they have different purposes you don't say well I'm I eat protein so I don't eat leafy greens right it's like it's a balanced life yeah Liberation from the thoughts and feelings that perpetually infiltrate our mind requires us to deal with them directly failing to do so will most likely lead to anger to anxiety to frustration and while we may not always be responsible for the feelings that well up within us we can certainly hold ourselves accountable for how we deal with those negative emotions to help illustrate the effectiveness of that accountability I turn to the New York Times best-selling author Dan Harris Dan is a former award-winning television journalist for ABC News a Nightline host and a former co-host of the weekend edition of Good Morning America he is also the author of the book 10 happier and host of the podcast of the same name with over 20 years of experience in the field Dan has reported on some of the most significant events of our time from Wars and conflicts to presidential elections and natural disasters but despite his professional success Dan has suffered from chronic anxiety and panic attacks which led him to explore the world of meditation and mindfulness he is now a dedicated practitioner and advocate for the mental and physical benefits of mindfulness including how it allows us to delve more deeply into the fundamental mystery of our own existence in episodes 97 and 346 I sat with Dan to capture the essence of The Beginner's mind the Simplicity of starting and the cultivation of a practice that deflects all excuses Dan disabuses us of the notion that meditation is an elitist skill and shares his insights into the relationship between meditation and happiness these excerpts reinforce the concept that the ability to meditate is common and the rewards extremely valuable making us healthier and happier even if only by 10 percent I've heard Sam Harris your friend talk about the the kind of half-life of negative emotions Sam is uh a valued friend of mine and he has said many brilliant things that I steal that is one of them he talks about one of the benefits of meditation having to do with the half-life of anger that you know we still are going to experience difficult emotions um unless you're enlightened if you even believe in that um and I I don't know if I believe in it um I don't know you gotta write this other book yeah I'm gonna write this up the pursuit of Enlightenment yes um uh we are still going to experience negative emotions the mystery of Consciousness is we don't know where our thoughts and feelings come from they come out of a void you can't which is liberating to know because there's no point holding yourself responsible we have a feeling you know impatience with our child and patients with our spouse whatever and we tend to get into these knots of self laceration around I'm this kind of person as a consequence of having just had this feeling we didn't invite the feeling it just came out of a void we don't know where it came from you can't hold yourself responsible for what you feel but you can hold yourself responsible for how you deal with it and so when anger ambushes you for me I I deal with a lot of anger um if I can see it if I have an inter meteorologist that can tell me when the storm is brewing is about to hit landfall make landfall then it I may either let it pass and not be taken over by it or I may get a few miles down the road with it you know a couple minutes of doing something stupid but then I catch myself it the amount of damage as Sam says that you can do in two minutes of anger as opposed to an hour of anger is incalculable and that is the fruit of meditation to me it's like interrogating the mystery a little bit if you can do this little exercise which is a Buddhist exercise that Tibetan exercises um you know close your eyes and hear whatever sounds were there you know there's all sorts of sounds my voice maybe the little tape hiss whatever and then ask yourself what is hearing this and you won't find it but in the not finding as the Buddhists say there is this kind of Liberation because you're not you're seeing how you're seeing the mystery the fundamental mystery of your own identity and of our existence and that can disidentify disentangle you from all of the suffering that we're creating of just being so entangled with our thoughts and and our stories and all that stuff it's not magic and it's not permanent unless again you're enlightened but it can in Just moment after moment there's this kind of theory in meditation in circles of short moments many times that if you just kind of are touching this mystery over and over and over again it has the net effect of making you lighter uh uh and and pushing you closer toward Enlightenment whether you believe that's a thing or not as beautiful as that sentiment is the prospect of of really confronting that in yourself is terrifying because we're sort of raised and taught to to um you know identify with these stories that we tell ourselves about who we are I am this per I am Dan I am a journalist I am rich I am whatever right and we we craft these narratives around identity that we delude ourselves are real and so to kind of engage with what you were just talking about is to kind of dismantle that yeah but in a certain way yeah that's right but there are two ways there are two the Buddhists talk about this in a way that actually is comforting which is to there are kind of two levels to life two levels to reality there's the relative truth you know you still are rich you you know on the day-to-day basis you know even if Rich doesn't exist on some deep level you still you still have to put your pants on in the morning and um you still need your podcast equipment if you want to do a podcast and that that is just the truth on a sort of relative on one on the on the level in which most of us operate on which most of us operate most of the time but there is a deeper truth which they often call ultimate truth which is kind of it can be roughly um analogized to quantum physics so like this table that you and I are doing an interview on is a table but at the deepest level it's a bunch of spinning atoms in empty space and so the same is true with the self and so you don't need to get you don't need to get too wrapped up in this it's just it's just a it's a it's a useful thing to think of in so much as it can help you not get so wrapped up in your own stories so what was it that uh I mean you so you're reading Epstein you're reading about the Buddhism and the Buddha uh but what was that first experience of saying okay I'm gonna sit down and I'm gonna try that like walk me through like day one okay so it was kind of a cumulative thing where I realized okay one meditation does not require lighting intents sitting in a funny position chanting things in Sanskrit uh or joining a group or paying fees uh that it's actually very you know it's a simple thing to do the mindfulness meditation the kind of meditation that's really been studied the most in Labs basically involves trying to watch the feeling of your breath coming in and going out and every time your mind wanders which it will a million times you just forgive yourself and return your attention to your breath so it's very very simple so when I learned that it was that was one piece of the buy when I learned that there was a science that showed that it can help with everything from blood pressure to your immune system to rewiring key parts of your brain that have to do with uh compassion and well-being and happiness and stress that was another thing um uh well let's just leave it there when I learned those two things I I over time my resistance broke down and I was on vacation in the summer of 2000 nine uh right after I got married as a matter of fact and um I uh was reading a book uh by the pool at a house that we're renting with some friends and I was like [ __ ] it let's just do it uh can I say [ __ ] you say whatever you want um uh so I I put the book down and I went to our room I sneaked off to our my the room that I was sharing with my wife and lock the door and just did it did it for five minutes I set an alarm on my BlackBerry and did it for five minutes and uh it sucked you know it was like really hard um but I realized in that moment that it was kind of a baller ass activity like it's really hard to wrestle your mind to the ground and um just like you find running uh triathlons to be a huge challenge that requires grit um uh to be compelling because the challenge in and of itself is interesting uh and and it pushes you further than you beyond your your comfort zone and uh tests you and also has beneficial effects I realized this is the same thing this is the same thing and actually has potentially the effects are potentially even much more profound um so I just decided you know what I'm gonna do this I'm gonna go for it and I'm gonna do it five minutes a day in perpetuity see what happens and you weren't other than the the two principles that you related there was no Dogma around this or kind of super complicated strategy of how you're doing it because I think people get really caught up and well I don't know how to do it you know it's like I don't understand how this works and and I think that that acts as a barrier or an impediment to just you know beginning yeah so my whole game now is I'm trying to remove every single excuse you have so uh the one excuses that people say I don't know how to do it which is actually the worst lamest excuse because you can Google how to meditate and it's like I can I I explained it once to the tech reporter from The New York Times and fewer characters than it takes to send a tweet tweet so it's really simple like step one sit down close your eyes keep your spine straight so you don't fall asleep step two try to feel where your breath is coming in usually it's your nose your belly and just feel the breath coming in and going out and step number three is every time your mind gets lost which I guarantee is going to happen a million times a million times you just catch your mind wandering and start again and start again and don't start getting pissed at yourself because that's happening you you may not be able to help it you may actually get pissed to yourself but just notice I'm getting pissed at myself and then start again and that's cool and over time what you learn is these waves of anger or self-judgment or an itch on your knee or uh um uh pain in your uh on your back or whatever that these are actually just passing phenomena that you can view non-judgmentally and dispassionately and objectively kind of like journalists are supposed to view the news and uh that is the aforementioned superpower which is that in the rest of your life quote unquote off the cushion uh when you're not meditating and you're overtaken by anger or annoyance or impatience some percentage of the time you'll be able to resist you'll be able to say oh I see what's going on here I'm starting to get angry but I don't need to take the bait and the bait is when we do the things that we regret most in our life when we eat when we're not hungry when we lose our temper with uh our loved ones when we ignore our kids when they're uh trying to talk to us because we're checking our Blackberry all the [ __ ] that where we are most ashamed of is because we're getting yanked around by this voice in the head this is the Kryptonite it's a massive pain in the ass I'm not gonna lie to you so I'm not saying like you're gonna a I'm not saying you're gonna sit down and meditate and it's gonna be super sweet and fun um B I'm not saying that it's going to turn your life into a Non-Stop parade of rainbows and unicorns this is why I called the book 10 happier it's a hard thing to do and it will have benefits in your life but it's not going to solve all of your problems an acknowledgment that existence includes an element of suffering is a well-renowned tenet of the teachings of the Buddha and in outgrowth of those teachings is the vipassana method of meditation a practice of observing your thoughts and emotions as they are without judging or dwelling on them this form of Insight Meditation aims to penetrate through the illusions that we have constructed around ourselves because behind those Illusions is pure Consciousness light brilliant and true in unadulterated awareness that when achieved is a form of Enlightenment this next excerpt features Buddhist teacher Sharon salzberg Sharon is a world-renowned meditation teacher and New York Times best-selling author who has played a crucial role in bringing meditation and mindfulness practices to mainstream Western culture since 1974. Salzburg is the author of 11 books including loving kindness real change and real love the art of mindful connection which was the focus of this conversation recorded in the spring of 2017. Sharon is also a regular columnist for on being a contributor to the Huffington Post and the host of her own podcast The Meta hour Salzburg has taught and mentored thousands of people worldwide and is revered for her expertise in loving-kindness meditation a practice that cultivates compassion and empathy here Salzburg unpacks the essence of loving-kindness meditation and how it can help us develop a deeper sense of connection with ourselves and with others she delves into the fundamentals of this practice highlighting the importance of setting an intention and developing a mindset of warmth and openness I'll let her explain from our talk from episode 298. the experience that a lot of people have when they when they begin you know kind of an intensive meditation practice for the first time they think they're all good you know and then suddenly they're crying uncontrollably and they have all this rage or whatever and they're like I thought this was supposed to make me I thought I was happy like this is this is a [ __ ] you know yeah and you're saying no you're exactly where where you need to be because you're actually confronting your suffering for the very first time and that's that's part of this process of you know acknowledgment and ultimately working through it I mean this is a little bit my story is a little bit in this book it's it's much more extensively in this book faith and many many people come up to me and say I had a childhood just like yours or I really understand so it's hardly rare actually in the components on Buddhism which was most of it when I heard the Buddhists say there's suffering in life that this is a natural part of life um it was the most probably the most liberating thing I'd ever heard right to be born is to suffer some people want us to suffer and it was finally the thought it's not just me you know because I've been so different from everybody else all those years like what do you say and French class when you're supposed to say what your father does for a living in French it's like I don't know how to say this you know or uh and suddenly there was no sense of being excluded you know it's like we're all suffering this is not always you know not not that life is horrible but there's always suffering in someone's life somewhere along the line and and that's the truth and I felt incredibly free just by that statement and then I heard about these practices called meditation where you could actually do something about your mind and be happier and it was like I looked around Buffalo New York and at that time I didn't find it anywhere you know I might have been there but now it's probably everywhere but uh I just didn't see it so the school had an independent study program where if you created a project that they liked you could go anywhere for a year theoretically and then come back so I created a project I want to go to India right so you have this initial Meditation Retreat and this is your introduction I mean that began as a vipassana retreat yeah it was a pleasant and it kind of ended with you being introduced to meta so so maybe describe the difference between those two Traditions okay so the question is um a word in Pali which is the language of the original Buddhist text it just means Insight Meditation so uh that one particular style of doing meditation has come to be associated with the word vipassana the teacher was SN goenka and uh it was just a kind of mostly mindfulness of the body and Body Sensations and it experiencing everything like emotions and thoughts through those Sensations um and that he The Retreat began with just a kind of awareness of the breath which is a practice most people get familiar with first they're just resting your attention on the feeling of the breath and bringing your attention back when it wanders which is continuous um and then this awareness of the body so right at the end going uh led a Mezza meta Retreat meditation and that was almost like a ceremonial way of ending The Retreat Mecha means loving kindness and poly so that was the moment I heard oh there's another style there's another way of practicing and that's kind of interesting it's all about love it's about filling your being with the sense of love that's how you start and extending it to all others and I longed for that certainly and I looked for that for and that became your sweet spot yeah right and did you were you aware of that at that moment like this is going to be my thing no and because I was so naive and so young and I didn't know how I mean I knew that there was a way of doing it intensively um with structure and stuff but I didn't know what it was and and just so we're clear like so the vipassana you're you're it's really focused on the breath but the actual practice of of meta is repetition of a mantra but not a mantra in the traditional sense it's sort of like these sayings right where you're emitting loving kindness into the world yeah it's it we consider it like a practice of generosity so it's offering you know instead of um looking through you I look at you and and think maybe happy maybe peaceful or whatever the particular thing is and the process of of really engaging that comes back again to owning your attention yeah right yeah and and you kind of lay it out in a book in this four-step process that you call brain right can you walk me through that so a rain is something that is often used especially when um a difficult emotion comes up but you can use it many many ways so let's say anger comes up in your experience rather than dismissing it or explaining it or hating yourself for it or plotting Revenge you want to just look at the feeling and this is something that's rare with strong emotion usually we get so captivated by the object like if you really really want something you think about the thing like I just bought a new car you know so it's like what color and you know and what thing what feature we very rarely kind of pivot our attention to look at the feeling itself like what does it feel like to want something so much or what does it feel like to be so angry we're so frightened so that first that's the first step that's kind of pivoting and then we apply This Acronym rain the first is recognize what's happening like oh it's anger uh the second is acknowledge it or accept it you know don't add on to it the shame and the distress and the fear and all of that just be with it as it is uh the third is I is investigate you know look into it not why is it here and what am I going to do about it but if we really look at a state of anger we will likely see fear we will see sadness we see grief we'll likely see helpless helplessness um and we have a much clearer sense of what is actually cooking you know below the surface and we also see it's constantly changing look at that you know it has just kind of this nature of uh arising and passing away and then and not non-identification is you know you don't have to fall into I'm such an angry person I will be forever this itself is a passing State and um it's a very different way of being with those kinds of emotions do you have like a a a loving-kindness practice that you could kind of share somebody could fit somebody could walk away from this and start to do sure I mean uh the simplest one is probably choose like two or three phrases that are the gift you would like to give to yourself like man be peaceful may I calm down you know but they need to be big enough so you can then use the same pretty much the same phrases for others uh so that's why people use things like maybe happy may it be peaceful and just sit quietly for a few moments and make that offering to yourself and just keep repeating the phrases your mind will wander everywhere don't worry about that uh you can let go of the distractions one by one it's okay and just come back to the phrases don't like count on some you know tremendous feeling coming up and uh just do it a little bit then think of somebody you really care about uh usually someone's helped you that even if you've never met them they've inspired you um and offer the phrases to them even if the words don't seem perfect they're like a conduit for that way of connecting and then just for fun have that person or for the phrases back to you so that you're in the position of the recipient yeah that's a weird feeling yeah right yeah that brings up all kinds of weird emotions it does you know it's interesting when you do that yes I just gave you a very provocative exercise rather than one that's good what about like you know sometimes like I'll develop a resentment against somebody else and and it will like monopolize my thinking and it really undermines the quality of my day or my week right so uh you know in recovery they say like you know pray for that person like wish them well so there's a I'm sure there's a loving kindness version of that where you're like wishing well on that person because you're the one who's suffering as a result of that resentment right and the path to Freedom Is by you know decoupling yourself from that emotion exactly and I wouldn't neglect in that case loving kindness for yourself uh I would intermingle it either start with yourself and move to that person or uh do yourself together may we be happy may we be peaceful because you're right you know of course resentment is such a corrosive Relentless feeling and uh it's so obsessive it's like the amount of time any of us can spend going through the list of someone's faults and then we go through it again and then again and again and then again you know it's very tiring so what does your practice look like um I practice every day uh different lengths my goal is to try to do like 40 minutes a day if not all at once then in chunks you know um I try to practice in informal times like walking down the streets especially with loving kindness uh walking down the streets of New York City or sitting on an airplane silently repeating you may be happy or may all beings be happy uh which is quite fun it's a whole other way of being in New York um and I try to do Retreats at least periodically but it's the I think it's the everydayness of it that really saves me right so there's the formal part of the practice and then there's carrying that into your interactions in the world which is a form of practice in and of itself right yeah in any kind of practice there are pitfalls that can derail the practitioner and meditation is not immune from these types of stops and starts one stumbling block can easily erase early enthusiasm for meditation before it can be helpful that's why having a meditation teacher can be so vitally important just like in sports there are fundamental mechanics to meditation that can be conveyed from a teacher to student to ensure a successful practice to educate us further on this teacher-student relationship and to share his easy e-a-s-y meditation technique is the very popular author and meditation teacher light Watkins light is the author of the books Bliss Moore and knowing where to look as well as a prolific public speaker and the founder of the shine a self-realization event series that was quite active prior to the pandemic here is light Watkins and that kind of tracks back to I mean the root of that really is that these Traditions if you want to differentiate them uh are are really rooted in the importance of the teacher-student relationship which I think really distinguishes this tradition or these Traditions from other forms of meditation that are a little bit looser about that restriction or that requirement it's like this this reverence for how important that is and in your own experience clearly this was an important thing like you'd been exposed to meditation you know for a number of years until you actually had formal instruction with a teacher and that was really the the defining thing that changed your life experience yeah that's right I I think one of the ways that we talk about it is that you know there are obviously going to be some obstacles and some pitfalls in anyone's meditation uh trajectory and being a teacher and having been through that path you kind of know where those pitfalls are going to be what the phases are what the Cycles are and you can help help someone maintain a level of self-sufficiency in their own practice so that it can continue to be mobile and accessible no matter where someone is no matter um what's around them they can still sit down and drop into this this meditative State as often as they as they as they choose to so um having a teacher is really one of the more invaluable aspects of this particular approach to meditation but like I said it's you know it's it's just one approach all the approaches of meditation are definitely taking the practitioner in the same direction which is towards accessing their their uh their true self and if you have a teacher and what I've experienced is that the the road tends to be a little bit easier right now and but they would also are my colleagues would also argue that you can't learn how to meditate from a book you can't get what you get from a teacher in a book so it was an interesting opportunity for me in writing a book and this and and presenting some of these mechanics and and uh principles in such a way that someone who doesn't necessarily have contact with the teacher directly can still glean some insight and hopefully improve their experiences through what they read in that book Bliss Moore well there's no barrier to entry right you know it's like you're teaching you practicing I mean you can't you can't teach Vedic or TM without being certified in a very specific manner but anybody can call themselves a meditation team that's right just get up and pontificate so when somebody when you overhear somebody saying there's no wrong way to meditate right like what is your your like actually there is well it's like saying there's no wrong way to swim yeah I mean uh you know sure you can get in there and just kind of mess around but if you want to be able if you're not drowning so you're I guess you're swimming if you want to glide back and forth and do kick turns and their their practice their mechanics that everyone who's and you use that you use that analogy in the book which I love because as a swimmer myself like I know very well the difference between somebody who really understands how to swim yeah and somebody who to the untrained eye kind of looks like they're swimming but when I look at them I'm like you're fighting eating the water the whole principle with swimming is trying to make the water work for you and the way that you turn it yeah exactly it's like this beautiful Symphony where everything all the movements that you're making with your body are in concert to make you go forward and you have to like Leverage the principles of fluid dynamics to propel yourself forward and you draw in that analogy to like look this is the same way it works with meditation rather than fighting the mind it's about the opposite of that yeah and it's you know and you're not just because you know that doesn't mean it is going to happen the first few times it's like swimming you know you have to practice it and keep integrating those mechanics over and over and then you end up being able to do less and accomplish more do listen accomplish most and ultimately do nothing where it feels like I'm in complete flow right now and you can swim for however however long you swim and it doesn't feel like this big effort where it's wearing you out and you're gonna drown and and so then someone like you can look at a pool or a lake or an ocean and you just see Joy where someone like me when I was in my early 30s and I couldn't swim I would look at the same body of water and just be completely terrified and wondering how deep is it and how cold is it and how rough is it and you know because I knew that once I got in if I didn't have an exit strategy then there was going to be problems and that's how people feel about meditation in the context of meditation rather than like I got to get my 20 minutes in twice a day if you're doing it wrong like okay let's step back and like let me explain to you actually how to do this properly so that you can leverage the most out of it for your experience so this is something that you you walk through in the course of this book you have this easy technique that you talk about so maybe we can kind of dive into that yeah the easy technique so there's this idea that in order for meditation to be most effective you have to sit up straight and you have to cross your legs that hasn't been my experience you know I was taught the first day I met my teacher you should actually sit like you're watching television and that frees up your mind to get lost in an experience right and the way you you interact with your mind you know you focus on this focus on that visualize this that wasn't my experience I was taught you let your mind roam free and that's getting back to the easy approach easy is an acronym for how you and how you handle your your mental and and Sensational experiences e stands for embrace a stands for accept s for surrender Y and yield to so what are you embracing accepting surrendering to and yielding to all of your mental emotional even physical experiences during the meditation so if you have an itch you scratch it if you get uncomfortable you switch your position so that you remain comfortable if you have thoughts about work that's amazing it's not just I'm just gonna accept it no no you look at it you celebrate it this is amazing again it's the best thing that could be happening right now is me thinking about this work problem or me thinking about how I don't like myself right that goes back to that that overcoming this urge or this uh idea that you have to combat the monkey mind right and you stop looking at it as a monkey mind you start looking at it as a noble mind the mind is it's like taking it it's like if your radio station was tuned into a music you don't like you take the speaker and you throw it against the wall because you don't like it's not the speaker the speaker is just projecting what's coming out of the channel and the mind is just projecting what's coming out of the body it's not a bad mind it's just showing you what's leaving the body so it requires a complete reframing of the experience which over time is going to allow the practitioner to start to um have a completely different relationship with their mind and then that's going to create a little bit of space in the meditation which allows you to sit there and enjoy it more and more and then the irony of all of this is that when you are seeing your mind as an ally and not the enemy of the practice that place you want to go to the place where everybody wants to go to the calmness the quietness the deepness that's where you go that it's it's literally how long is it going to take I've seen how can I can I get there quickly I've seen people get there and literally within an hour really of practicing absolutely yeah I mean this is I want to make a disclaimer this is working with me one-on-one and that's when I'm suggesting anyone needs to do but I did the very best I could to put those principles in this book so that you know if you or take it seriously enough and you follow the instructions as written then you're going to have that experience pretty quickly our human frailties are ever present they tend to propel Us in directions that we know are counterproductive and meditation is a way to constructively recognize them when we sit in Stillness with our demons and choose not to react to them simple acknowledgment becomes a powerful antidote to harmful emotions and actions but the act of cultivating a meditation practice can also help us create other helpful habits in our lives if we can start the habit of meditating the mental and emotional benefits will show us that we are also capable of so much more this is the perspective of my next guest Leo Baba Leo is a renowned author speaker and productivity expert who has made a name for himself by teaching individuals how to cultivate inner peace and increase Focus his expertise in the field of meditation is quite extensive and he offers valuable insights into the art of mindfulness Leo's work focuses

single author blogs in the world with fnatic global fan base in the millions named one of Time magazine's top 10 blogs Leo was indisputably one of the first prominent voices on the internet advocating the power and beauty of embracing Simplicity and mindfulness to transcend the chaos of our daily existence through his writing he has taught Millions how to clear the mental emotional financial and physical clutter so that we can focus on what's most important create something amazing and find contentment purpose and meaning in our lives in this clip Leo delves into his own personal meditation practice discussing how he integrates mindfulness into his daily life his words are a testament to the transformative power of meditation and sir serve as a reminder of the benefit that can be gained from even the smallest moments of introspection from episode 284 this is me and Leo Baba but what do I do um my daily practices I um I meditate and it's nothing not a like amazing you know Advanced meditation and I just meditate on the breath mostly right so there's no specific uh approach or I follow the generally I follow the Zen Buddhist style of zazen and um the are like the just just sitting kind of thing but um lately I've been returning to the basic practice of just counting the breath which is something that I started with and then thought I was like moving on and beyond that and I realized that I've uh there's actually a lot of profoundity profundity in that um and so I'm rediscovering just counting breath um and that's like something that when you start out and you probably have had this experience like okay when do I move Beyond counting breaths you know I need to get you know behind the Velvet Rope into the next VIP room of meditation yeah so like what's the next level and so you're always looking for that and that's actually really good to see that tendency in your mind to want to go beyond that um which is again that greed coming into play but so if you return to that which is such a basic practice and it's like so boring right or at least that's how our minds usually read it but actually you're just it's a practice of just fully being there fully embodied with each breath and realizing that that is all there is and it's like that breath is unique and not like the next breath and it's never going to come again and that's exactly what we want to do it's just in each experience each moment to see that that's unique and it will will never have this moment back this one that we're having between me and you right now we're never gonna have it again and if we can just fully be here in this moment as we are looking into each other's masculine eyes we like this is an amazing experience for me and if I'm not fully here with it I'm looking to the next thing okay what what's what's the next level thing that I can be doing I'm gonna be missing out on this amazing experience and there's nothing more profound than anchoring yourself completely in the present moment that's right right so the idea I think our minds are always looking for the advanced program or am I progressing you know with respective meditation and ultimately it's so simple yeah so something within that Simplicity I suppose but there's no you could Plumb the depths of it for the rest of your life yeah I mean and anyone who's practiced breath counting knows that it's a simple practice like the instructions you can take in one minute but actually doing it is it's pretty tough because of our minds like you know wanting to get away from this moment like this is boring why am i counting my breath so you want to like and you start to think about what else you have to do for today and that conversation that you had yesterday that's still sticking with you and all of these you know ego driven things but if we can just let go of that ego and just stay with the breath and it's transformative but it like I said it's pretty hard because of our minds Tendencies and it's fleeting yeah right all right so how long do you do that for um it varies lately it's like when I I feel rushed I should be doing it longer but I actually do it shorter I'm just like okay I don't have time because I have so much to do and so when I notice myself just doing it for like 10 minutes a day I realize like my mind is is doing that like wanting to like just get through the meditation and just check it off the list which is not really fully being there with it um so that lately it has been that which is a public confession really like my yeah my mind is definitely rushing off to the next thing and especially when I travel it's like I have so much that I that I want to do against that greed tendency like I want to do all of this stuff here in LA and meet all these amazing people I'm not doing that but it's that's my mind's tendency so it's like okay I only can do 10 minutes of meditation but I you know ideally and I don't really hold to the ideals but you know 20 to 30 minutes would be amazing okay yeah so that's right when you that's upon waking ideally yeah yeah yeah I basically told everybody I knew that I'm quitting smoking because before that I I would just say okay I'm gonna quit today to myself because I didn't want people to know and so you always have an out yep and then later that day I took a puff and then was smoking by the end of the day so it wasn't a big thing it was like a minor commitment in my mind so I had to make it this is something I'm committing to and I made it publicly I asked for support I found a support Community uh which was accountability but also like when I'm when I need support I'm going to reach out to you before I before I smoke and ask for your help and these are people who are going through it with me um so that support and accountability and Community was really important um and then meditation was that's when I discovered meditation actually was when the urge to smoke was arising and it was very uncomfortable and I would normally not even notice it um I started to just sit with it and watch it rise and get strong and strong and like so powerful and then let it some concrete first steps yeah so the the thing that we did with you where you're feeling that energy and sitting with it I think that's the most important thing that they can do and yeah that can be a difficult thing so having some kind of practice container for that whether it's sitting in for five ten minutes of meditation and actually I recommend people as a habit building thing start with two minutes of meditation um and yeah I know you um you used to use I don't know if you still do the the headspace app that's a great one um there's I use uh insight timer another great meditation app there's some good ones on there that just can give you some guided meditation to start with um I found that meditation to be one of the best like fundamental habits that that helps you to build other habits and helps you along all of these Journeys um so yeah I would start with that and if you can if you are a procrastinator I'm actually doing a whole um thing with a program that I have on procrastination this month and it's just like watching your patterns and the way that I I you can instead of doing meditation if you want to work on procrastination it's the same exact thing but say okay before I check my phone before I check email or Facebook on my computer All I'm gonna do is set aside five minutes maybe 10 minutes a day depending on where you are um if you're super procrastinator do five minutes so five minutes a day before I check anything and I'm going to set myself a task one little task that will take like five minutes of writing my chapter right um so write five five minutes of this chapter and I'm gonna set a timer and I'm gonna set an intention to stay with my discomfort and you set that timer and you stay with it and you're gonna watch yourself wanna run like I'll start the timer in a minute because I'm gonna go do my dishes or whatever you know and you want to stay there so you're you're you have two choices sit there and do that task or just sit there and you can't let yourself run and this is a intentional like kind of corralling yourself in and just watching that urge and then practice with that urge so just sit there and watch the discomfort where is it located in your body not your your thinking like oh you know there's always stories that are going on like am I gonna fail like are people gonna judge me all these stories but what you want to do is go into that body feeling that we we talked about where is it located what does it feel like describe the energy the physical energy in your body and then stay with that and then when you feel like that's you know gone to a point where it's not not overwhelming go back to the writing your chapter I'm gonna try that all right that sounds good and if you are a uh a master at this already uh do 10 minutes and if you're even better than that do 15 minutes and if you want and if you get to that level where you can do 15 minutes straight take a break have some tea as as Rich likes to do and um and do another 15 minutes after that so it's like interval training um and you don't have to do like you know 20 intervals you can just do two or three uh but but build up to that start with the five minutes right so it's like a work it's like a workout for your brain for your Consciousness it's training and staying with uncertainty and discomfort and because you want you're rebuilding those you're rebuilding those Pathways and then trying to reinforce them yeah and the the side benefit is you'll do your taxes yeah exactly right unless you want to be the the guy who just sits there does nothing hey that that's a practice too right I guess so right hopefully by now you can see the vast benefits of meditation and even have some practical ideas on how to begin but there is still one pesky subject left to address time fitting meditation into our everyday schedule and for this topic I can think of no one better than Jason Garner scraping his way from a weekend job at a flea market to owning his own concert company by the time he was 37 Jason Garner had become CEO of global music at Live Nation entertainment the world's largest concert promotion company and arguably the most important corporate entity in the entire music industry Garner an incredibly successful entrepreneur and author decided to leave his lucrative and and might I add time-consuming corporate gig to make it his mission to help others find inner peace and purpose today Jason's expertise in mindfulness and meditation has been sought after by Fortune 500 companies top athletes and high performing Executives in this final clip Jason shares his insights on how we can carve out the time to meditate even in the midst of our busy schedules in a world that glorifies the hustle and the grind it can be easy to neglect our own well-being however as Jason reminds us taking a few minutes to pause and to connect with our inner cells can actually make us more productive and more focused in the long run his tips on creating a personalized meditation practice that suits our individual needs and goals are truly invaluable so here is Jason Garner and then so I would say you know like I just think we can start with simple things like a deep breath you know we can in fact you know we can start with some meditation and we can start with some nutrition we can start with yoga and they would say to me and these are like you know 18 year old young people well I'll have time for that and I would say you know what just right here just the question you got to ask yourself is what am I building you're [ __ ] 18 and you don't have time to breathe and I'll just tell you I'm double your age now you know more and it doesn't get easier it's not like after University then in comes that breathing space that we've always wanted it's like we have to carve that into our you know what I call Daily practice and in between you know getting up and checking your Facebook and running off to class and doing doing the homework and running the football game and doing all these things that we do we've got to build in some time for ourselves and some breathing room and one of the beautiful things that I found in my life is that it's not a Time allocation issue so it's not like work-life balance is like well I went four hours at work and now I gotta do four hours of meditation it's like we've so neglected ourselves that's really similar to any relationship that we've neglected you know if you don't talk to your wife for a week first time you walk into the room and say honey I'm sorry I love you that has a huge value like that counts for a whole bunch of talking that you didn't do and so that first time that we walk in and sit down on meditation cushion and take a deep breath and connect with our heart and maybe that lasts one minute right but that minute's worth a whole hole bunch and so for me that's really what I've learned is like we're just creatures of habit and before I used to have a habit called work myself to death and now I have a habit called just love myself to life right and this is you know I was like that's and in there it kind of becomes inconsequential what you do with the rest of times okay then you go to work or you flip the guy off on the road you know all this stuff that happens in our life keeps happening but we have these moments where we can come back to our heart and we can remember that we're human beings and right and not robots you know right right right like I get it I understand it I know that I need this I'm happier when I'm doing it but they're holding on to that identity and they're still like yes but you know I still need to be successful and I want this and I'm afraid of going in too deep of taking as deep a left turn as you did because you know I don't want to be you know I don't I don't know that I want to be like you and running off to China I still want to be CEO of my company or whatnot so it's about like carrying these practices in the world I mean how do you kind of communicate with people that are coming from that perspective I think one of the things is that we tend to be so extremist in the way that we view things so the first thing that I like to say is like there's a long way from here to there like you can't breathe and you're worried that someday you might turn into a hippie like Jason who goes off to China so it's like you know let's just start with step one you know and let's just take a deep breath and and and just you know sometimes it's like it's not so much about transformation but it's like were gripping so hard onto this reality that we that we perceive to be us right and so you know the fear comes from if like you could just picture like if you're just gripping onto you know you're in the water right and you're gripping on to a life raft and the fear comes from if I say I'm tick let go of the life raft right now that's like too big of a step I think you know it's like that that's that's really hard for us as human beings but if we said hey from here to three years or from here to five years we're gonna just slowly let go and so today today's part of that plan is just to loosen our grip a little bit and then we don't have to think so far you know down it's like you know in in health it's like most a lot of us who are taking care of ourselves have an idea that we'd like to have a long life we'd like to live you know I always say I want to live to be 140 years old and I have friends who go like that's crazy I said but understand that my body rebuilds it sells every seven years so I don't have a 140 year plan I have a seven year plan and I think the same thing can be true in caring for ourselves and in in kind of like refiguring our lives a little bit is we don't have to have the what am I going to do in 10-year plan we can just have right now I'm just going to loosen up a little bit and see how that feels and or I'm gonna sit and breathe for a little bit and see how that feels right and then don't jump 12 steps down the road because the whole point of mindfulness is being here and being mindful so just we're here there's a lot of stress let's let go of whatever piece of it we can and you you're welcome to cling to all the parts that you don't want to let go but is there just quick one or two things that we can let go of right now and I think that's how I try to approach my own my own life because there's really scary things that you know we've been carrying since we were kids and for someone to come along and go hey let's just jump in the pool right that's that's tough stuff yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah that's what all this is you know it's like I'm I study with teachers to learn tools and then I build a toolbox and I think you know if we use that analogy we're going through life with a hammer and we're trying to build the whole house with a hammer you know it's like we have our job and that's it you know and then the problem comes when you got to put a window in you know and you start breaking [ __ ] with the hammer and so what I've realized is I want to have a really full toolbox and when something's not working for me I want to have a different Tool The Hammer is not the right I want to have a screwdriver I want to have a wrench or in the case of meditation I want to have a few different techniques you know hey that one's not working very well right now great I'll try this you know and so that's kind of been my impetus for you know continuing to seek out new teachers because I find each one has a special little gem if you can just kind of get the intimate moment where you can spend some real time you get a little gem you know you get you get another tool that you then throw in the the toolbox because they're human beings who have lived their own version of what we're living and they had to figure out how to make it work for them and they figured out little tricks you know yeah tools along the way and and I think you said it when you said they're human beings because that's what they are and I think you know when you kind of enter into this world of new age spirituality you see a lot of uh we see a lot of things a lot of interesting things you know uh there's a lot of [ __ ] there's a lot of [ __ ] and there's a lot of uh I've joked about this before but like kind of you know staring a little bit too long into the other person's eyes and and you know holding the hug a little bit a beat too long for comfort you know and that kind of thing and a lot of Guru chasing right and then and then sort of propping up a guru and then when when that quote unquote Guru shows some level of humanity and a flaw that it's tearing that person down and and saying well they're they're they they have nothing of value because they demonstrated that they're a human being through some foible right um but in reality they all have little truths that you can extract and and you know kind of weave your own tapestry of what resonates for you and what works for you I I really feel that and I think there's a lot of fantastic stories out there and I actually tend to believe a lot of them you know I just I tend to believe that you know a lot of these Masters teachers who who are living in a different time and place and who had a lot of time to focus on their Consciousness and focus on their own Awakening and weren't distracted by honking cars in New York City that they that they very well may have achieved some things that we would look at today and go like oh that's [ __ ] yeah but meaning like that like the guys that go into the caves and don't eat for years and stuff like that right yeah you know people their bodies don't decompose and yeah or you know they see things or they know things that are coming or they can look at you and tell you something and then it's actually happening in your life and but I never wanted my practice to be dependent on that so I made a conscious decision that I was looking for real life teachers you know one of my teachers says get a piece of chocolate and put the chocolate on your tongue and just stay present as you Savor the taste of the chocolate you know it's like wow that's like yeah there is there's always a little bit of happiness there's always a little bit of joy that we can find but it takes really coming back and being present and then I think the second piece is that we just have to give ourselves enough space to move around to go head I'm 40 years old I'm 50 years old it took me 50 years to get here now I want to make some changes so first I'll honor where I'm at and then second I need to be realistic about I'm going to sit down and meditation today and probably nothing's gonna happen probably not going to feel any different in fact I'm going to feel more frustrated because I don't quite know how to do this thing called meditation right it's like we go so let's think a year down the road I'm going to give five minutes a day to meditation for a year and I think we start to open up the timeline a little bit it takes off some of that that urgency and in the and in the crisis of the moment what we have is the breath and what we have is the ability to find little ways that we can show ourselves that we're loved in little ways that we can care for ourselves and then we just do the best we can mm-hmm if you could go back to uh yourself as a 20 year old with the knowledge that you have now and the experience that you have now I mean what do you think your your life would have looked like I think you know I can't imagine a life much better than this you know it's like I think as you said you know through all the pain you just you find the beauty right it's like there's just these beautiful moments that happen in life I have a 17 year old son who I you know I realized the other day like if I've done nothing over the last five years I spent every day with my son you know and it's like I talk to him a lot about these things and I think his life will be different but I learned through him that even though he possesses all the tools and meets with all the same teachers he still has to go through the growth process of going of being him in life right so I think I think we can't go back and I think we're all just living this life that we're we're living and we get the tools when we get them and I think the beautiful part is just learn to be at peace and to be loving with ourselves no matter where we find ourselves on that path you know beautiful man meditation has been a Lifeline for me it's been a tool for gleaning invaluable insights into my own mind and for awakening a more compassionate view of myself and those around me I'm the benefactor of a practice that while not always consistent consistently rewards me when applied for each of us to minimize our own suffering and to contribute to minimizing the suffering of others meditation is a useful practical easier than it seems application My Hope Is that you can use this compilation episode as an inspiration and as a jumping off point for further self-inquiry and hopefully an Ever deepening practice if the voices you've heard here have spoken to you please consider going back to the original episodes to gain further insights from these amazing teachers many of the guests speaking about meditation here have written valuable books that amplify their perspective and philosophy and are surely worth checking out in a world that is increasingly more and more complex I'd love for this show and for my guests to be a lighthouse for you guiding you to safe harbors on the premise that we each have more to offer to the world and most importantly to ourselves so I hope you enjoyed this episode I hope you found it valuable I appreciate the love I love all the support and I will see you back here soon plants namaste [Music]


What meditation is all about
Meditation is a technique used for thousands of years to develop awareness of the present moment.
It can involve practices to sharpen focus and attention, connect to the body and breath, develop acceptance of difficult emotions, and even alter consciousness. It’s been shown to offer a number of physical and psychological benefits like stress reduction
Trusted Source
 and improved immunity.
While many spiritual traditions include meditation as a part of their teachings and practices, the technique itself doesn’t belong to any particular religion or faith. Though ancient in origin, it’s still practiced today in cultures all over the world to create a sense of peace, calm, and inner harmony.
Meditation may offer a solution to the growing need to reduce stress in the midst of busy schedules and demanding lives.
Although there isn’t a right or wrong way to meditate, it’s important to find a practice that meets your needs.
There are nine popular types of meditation practice:
* mindfulness meditation
* spiritual meditation
* focused meditation
* movement meditation
* mantra meditation
* transcendental meditation
* progressive relaxation
* loving-kindness meditation
* visualization meditation
Not all meditation styles are right for everyone. These practices require different skills and mindsets. How do you know which practice is right for you?
“It’s what feels comfortable and what you feel encouraged to practice,” says Mira Dessy, a meditation author and holistic nutritionist.
Keep reading to learn more about the different types of meditation and how to get started.
1. Mindfulness meditation
Mindfulness meditation originates from Buddhist teachings and is the most popular and researched form of meditation in the West.
In mindfulness meditation, you pay attention to your thoughts as they pass through your mind. You don’t judge the thoughts or become involved with them. You simply observe and take note of any patterns.
This practice combines concentration with awareness. You may find it helpful to focus on an object or your breath while you observe any bodily sensations, thoughts, or feelings.
This type of meditation is good for people who don’t have a teacher to guide them, as it can be easily practiced alone.

2. Spiritual meditation
Spiritual meditation is used in nearly all religions and spiritual traditions.
The types of spiritual meditation are as diverse as the world’s spiritual traditions themselves. Many of the meditation techniques listed in this article could be considered spiritual meditation.
According to a 2017 study
Trusted Source
, spiritual meditation focuses on developing a deeper understanding of spiritual/religious meaning and connection with a higher power. Examples include:
* Christian contemplative prayer
* Sufi dhikr (remembrance of God)
* Jewish kabbalistic practices
Spiritual meditation can be practiced at home or in a place of worship. This practice is beneficial for those who seek spiritual growth and a deeper connection to a higher power or spiritual force.
3. Focused meditation
Focused meditation involves concentration using any of the five senses.
For example, you can focus on something internal, like your breath, or you can bring in external influences to help focus your attention.
Examples include:
* counting mala beads
* listening to a gong
* staring at a candle flame
* counting your breaths
* moon gazing
This practice may be simple in theory, but it can be difficult for beginners to hold their focus for longer than a few minutes at first.
If your mind does wander, simply come back to the practice and refocus.
As the name suggests, this practice is ideal for anyone who wants to sharpen their focus and attention.
4. Movement meditation
Although most people think of yoga when they hear movement meditation, this practice may include:
* walking
* gardening
* qi gong
* tai chi
* other gentle forms of movement
This is an active form of meditation where the movement guides you into a deeper connection with your body and the present moment.
Movement meditation is good for people who find peace in action and want to develop body awareness.
5. Mantra meditation
Mantra meditation is prominent in many teachings, including Hindu and Buddhist traditions. This type of meditation uses a repetitive sound to clear the mind. It can be a word, phrase, or sound, one of the most common being “om.”
Your mantra can be spoken loudly or quietly. After chanting the mantra for some time, you’ll be more alert and in tune with your environment. This allows you to experience deeper levels of awareness.
Some people enjoy mantra meditation because they find it easier to focus on a word than on their breath. Others enjoy feeling the vibration of the sound in their body.
This is also a good practice for people who don’t like silence and enjoy repetition.

6. Transcendental Meditation
Transcendental Meditation (TM) is a type of meditation that’s been the subject of numerous studies in the scientific community.
TM was founded by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi and refers to a specific practice designed to quiet the mind and induce a state of calm and peace. It involves the use of mantra and is best taught by a certified TM practitioner.
This practice is for those who want an accessible approach to the depth that meditation offers.

7. Progressive relaxation
Also known as body scan meditation, progressive relaxation is a practice aimed at reducing tension in the body and promoting relaxation.
Oftentimes, this form of meditation involves slowly tightening and relaxing one muscle group at a time throughout the body.
In some cases, it may also encourage you to imagine a gentle wave flowing through your body to help release any tension.
This form of meditation is often used to relieve stress and unwind before bedtime.
8. Loving-kindness meditation
Loving-kindness meditation is used to strengthen feelings of compassion, kindness, and acceptance toward oneself and others.
It typically involves opening the mind to receive love from others and then sending well wishes to loved ones, friends, acquaintances, and all living beings.
Because this type of meditation is intended to promote compassion and kindness, it may be ideal for those holding feelings of anger or resentment.
9. Visualization meditation
Visualization meditation is a technique focused on enhancing feelings of relaxation, peace, and calmness by visualizing positive scenes, images, or figures.
This practice involves imagining a scene vividly and using all five senses to add as much detail as possible. It can also involve holding a beloved or honored figure in mind with the intention of embodying their qualities.
Another form of visualization meditation involves imagining yourself succeeding at specific goals, which is intended to increase focus and motivation.
Many people use visualization meditation to boost their mood, reduce stress levels, and promote inner peace.
How to get started
The easiest way to begin is to sit quietly and focus on your breath. An old Zen saying suggests, “You should sit in meditation for 20 minutes every day — unless you’re too busy. Then you should sit for an hour.”
All kidding aside, it’s best to start in small increments of time, even 5 or 10 minutes, and grow from there.
“Sit consistently for 20 minutes a day and do this for 100 days straight,” recommends Pedram Shojai, author of “The Urban Monk” and founder of Well.org. “Couple that with an additional 2 to 5 minutes of meditation throughout the day to break up the chaos, and you will soon be feeling the benefits.”
“You should sit in meditation for 20 minutes every day — unless you’re too busy. Then you should sit for an hour.”
—Zen proverb

 noted that non-transcendental meditation may be a “promising alternative approach” for lowering systolic and diastolic blood pressure, while a 2019 review found that mindfulness-based interventions reduced levels of the stress hormone cortisol in employees participating in workplace mindfulness programs.
It’s also been shown to encourage prosocial emotions and behaviors, enhance focus and mood, and reduce aggression while also encouraging positive coping strategies in times of stress.
A 2018 review suggests that meditation may contribute to healthy aging.
Meditation may also help with symptoms of specific conditions, including:
* depression and anxiety disorders
* cardiovascular disease, such as arterial hypertension
* Trusted Source

When it comes to depression, a 2019 review noted that mindfulness-based meditation has positive effects that may last up to 6 months or more. The same review notes that the lack of negative effects of mindfulness-based interventions makes them a promising supplemental therapy for depression and anxiety disorders.
A 2018 review found that meditation resulted in reductions in cognitive decline and perceived stress as well as increased quality of life, connectivity, and blood flow to the brain.
A 2017 study
Trusted Source
 found low-quality evidence that mindfulness meditation is associated with a small decrease in chronic pain compared with controls. More research is needed to solidify this connection.

Don’t be afraid to step out of your comfort zone and try different types. It often takes a little trial and error until you find the one that fits.
“Meditation isn’t meant to be a forced thing,” Dessy says. “If we’re forcing it, then it becomes a chore. Gentle, regular practice eventually becomes sustaining, supportive, and enjoyable.

Meditation can wipe away the day's stress, bringing with it inner peace. See how you can easily learn to practice meditation whenever you need it most.
By Mayo Clinic Staff
If stress has you anxious, tense and worried, you might try meditation. Spending even a few minutes in meditation can help restore your calm and inner peace.
Anyone can practice meditation. It's simple and doesn't cost much. And you don't need any special equipment.
You can practice meditation wherever you are. You can meditate when you're out for a walk, riding the bus, waiting at the doctor's office or even in the middle of a business meeting.
Understanding meditation
Meditation has been around for thousands of years. Early meditation was meant to help deepen understanding of the sacred and mystical forces of life. These days, meditation is most often used to relax and lower stress.
Meditation is a type of mind-body complementary medicine. Meditation can help you relax deeply and calm your mind.
During meditation, you focus on one thing. You get rid of the stream of thoughts that may be crowding your mind and causing stress. This process can lead to better physical and emotional well-being.
Benefits of meditation
Meditation can give you a sense of calm, peace and balance that can benefit your emotional well-being and your overall health. You also can use it to relax and cope with stress by focusing on something that calms you. Meditation can help you learn to stay centered and keep inner peace.
These benefits don't end when your meditation session ends. Meditation can help take you more calmly through your day. And meditation may help you manage symptoms of some medical conditions.
Meditation and emotional and physical well-being
When you meditate, you may clear away the information overload that builds up every day and contributes to your stress.
The emotional and physical benefits of meditation can include:
* Giving you a new way to look at things that cause stress.
* Building skills to manage your stress.
* Making you more self-aware.
* Focusing on the present.
* Reducing negative feelings.
* Helping you be more creative.
* Helping you be more patient.
* Lowering resting heart rate.
* Lowering resting blood pressure.
* Helping you sleep better.
Meditation and illness
Meditation also might help if you have a medical condition. This is most often true if you have a condition that stress makes worse.
A lot of research shows that meditation is good for health. But some experts believe there's not enough research to prove that meditation helps.
With that in mind, some research suggests that meditation may help people manage symptoms of conditions such as:
* Anxiety.
* Asthma.
* Cancer.
* Chronic pain.
* Depression.
* Heart disease.
* High blood pressure.
* Irritable bowel syndrome.
* Sleep problems.
* Tension headaches.
Be sure to talk to your healthcare professional about the pros and cons of using meditation if you have any of these or other health conditions. Sometimes, meditation might worsen symptoms linked to some mental health conditions.
Meditation doesn't replace medical treatment. But it may help to add it to other treatments.
Types of meditation
Meditation is an umbrella term for the many ways to get to a relaxed state. There are many types of meditation and ways to relax that use parts of meditation. All share the same goal of gaining inner peace.
Ways to meditate can include:
* Guided meditation. This is sometimes called guided imagery or visualization. With this method of meditation, you form mental images of places or things that help you relax.
You try to use as many senses as you can. These include things you can smell, see, hear and feel. You may be led through this process by a guide or teacher.
* Mantra meditation. In this type of meditation, you repeat a calming word, thought or phrase to keep out unwanted thoughts.
* Mindfulness meditation.This type of meditation is based on being mindful. This means being more aware of the present.
In mindfulness meditation, you focus on one thing, such as the flow of your breath. You can notice your thoughts and feelings. But let them pass without judging them.
* Qigong. This practice most often combines meditation, relaxation, movement and breathing exercises to restore and maintain balance. Qigong (CHEE-gung) is part of Chinese medicine.
* Tai chi. This is a form of gentle Chinese martial arts training. In tai chi (TIE-CHEE), you do a series of postures or movements in a slow, graceful way. And you do deep breathing with the movements.
* Yoga. You do a series of postures with controlled breathing. This helps give you a more flexible body and a calm mind. To do the poses, you need to balance and focus. That helps you to focus less on your busy day and more on the moment.
Parts of meditation
Each type of meditation may include certain features to help you meditate. These may vary depending on whose guidance you follow or who's teaching a class. Some of the most common features in meditation include:
   * Focused attention. Focusing your attention is one of the most important elements of meditation.
Focusing your attention is what helps free your mind from the many things that cause stress and worry. You can focus your attention on things such as a certain object, an image, a mantra or even your breathing.
   * Relaxed breathing. This technique involves deep, even-paced breathing using the muscle between your chest and your belly, called the diaphragm muscle, to expand your lungs. The purpose is to slow your breathing, take in more oxygen, and reduce the use of shoulder, neck and upper chest muscles while breathing so that you breathe better.
   * A quiet setting. If you're a beginner, meditation may be easier if you're in a quiet spot. Aim to have fewer things that can distract you, including no television, computers or cellphones.
As you get more skilled at meditation, you may be able to do it anywhere. This includes high-stress places, such as a traffic jam, a stressful work meeting or a long line at the grocery store. This is when you can get the most out of meditation.
   * A comfortable position. You can practice meditation whether you're sitting, lying down, walking, or in other positions or activities. Just try to be comfortable so that you can get the most out of your meditation. Aim to keep good posture during meditation.
   * Open attitude. Let thoughts pass through your mind without judging them.
Everyday ways to practice meditation
Don't let the thought of meditating the "right" way add to your stress. If you choose to, you can attend special meditation centers or group classes led by trained instructors. But you also can practice meditation easily on your own. There are apps to use too.
And you can make meditation as formal or informal as you like. Some people build meditation into their daily routine. For example, they may start and end each day with an hour of meditation. But all you really need is a few minutes a day for meditation.
Here are some ways you can practice meditation on your own, whenever you choose:
      * Breathe deeply. This is good for beginners because breathing is a natural function.
Focus all your attention on your breathing. Feel your breath and listen to it as you inhale and exhale through your nostrils. Breathe deeply and slowly. When your mind wanders, gently return your focus to your breathing.
      * Scan your body. When using this technique, focus attention on each part of your body. Become aware of how your body feels. That might be pain, tension, warmth or relaxation.
Mix body scanning with breathing exercises and think about breathing heat or relaxation into and out of the parts of your body.
      * Repeat a mantra. You can create your own mantra. It can be religious or not. Examples of religious mantras include the Jesus Prayer in the Christian tradition, the holy name of God in Judaism, or the om mantra of Hinduism, Buddhism and other Eastern religions.
      * Walk and meditate. Meditating while walking is a good and healthy way to relax. You can use this technique anywhere you're walking, such as in a forest, on a city sidewalk or at the mall.
When you use this method, slow your walking pace so that you can focus on each movement of your legs or feet. Don't focus on where you're going. Focus on your legs and feet. Repeat action words in your mind such as "lifting," "moving" and "placing" as you lift each foot, move your leg forward and place your foot on the ground. Focus on the sights, sounds and smells around you.
      * Pray. Prayer is the best known and most widely used type of meditation. Spoken and written prayers are found in most faith traditions.
You can pray using your own words or read prayers written by others. Check the self-help section of your local bookstore for examples. Talk with your rabbi, priest, pastor or other spiritual leader about possible resources.
      * Read and reflect. Many people report that they benefit from reading poems or sacred texts and taking a few moments to think about their meaning.
You also can listen to sacred music, spoken words, or any music that relaxes or inspires you. You may want to write your thoughts in a journal or discuss them with a friend or spiritual leader.
      * Focus your love and kindness. In this type of meditation, you think of others with feelings of love, compassion and kindness. This can help increase how connected you feel to others.
Building your meditation skills
Don't judge how you meditate. That can increase your stress. Meditation takes practice.
It's common for your mind to wander during meditation, no matter how long you've been practicing meditation. If you're meditating to calm your mind and your mind wanders, slowly return to what you're focusing on.
Try out ways to meditate to find out what types of meditation work best for you and what you enjoy doing. Adapt meditation to your needs as you go. Remember, there's no right way or wrong way to meditate. What matters is that meditation helps you reduce your stress and feel better overall.

Introduction
The practice of meditation has become popular in many Western nations, especially the USA. An ever-increasing body of research shows various health benefits associated with meditation and these findings have sparked interest in the field of medicine.[1,2,3] The practice of meditation originated in the ancient Vedic times of India and is described in the Vedic texts.[4,5,6,7] Meditation is one of the modalities used in Ayurveda (Science of Life), the comprehensive, natural health care system that originated in the ancient Vedic times of India.[8] The term “meditation” is now loosely used to refer to a large number of diverse techniques. These include contemplation, concentration, use of nature sounds such as the ocean, guided meditation, meditative movement exercises such as Yoga and tai chi, qigong, breathing exercises, and Mantra. These techniques work at different levels such as the senses, mind, intellect, and emotions. Some techniques are easy to learn and practice, while others are more difficult and can result in participants giving up the practice rather quickly. According to Vedic science (the knowledge of the Vedic texts of ancient India), the true purpose of meditation is to connect oneself to one's deep inner Self. Techniques which achieve that goal serve the true purpose of meditation.
The neurological and physiological correlates of meditative experiences have been investigated previously.[8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16] This article describes the process of meditation at a more fundamental level and aims to shed light on the deeper underlying mechanism of the beneficial effects associated with meditation. Research on the effects of meditation is summarized.

The process of meditation
To truly understand meditation, one has to understand how the human being is viewed by Vedic science - the knowledge of the Vedic texts of ancient India.[4,5,6,7] The human being consists of three aspects, with their associated functions:
         1. Physical body
         2. Inner faculty: The working consciousness, which is constantly changing. This consists of:
         * Mind: Processes sensory perceptions; has the quality of duality, as seen in pairs of opposites, for example, pleasure and pain, good and bad, hot and cold, etc.
         * Intellect: Analyzes, discriminates, decides, and judges
         * Ego: Doer and experiencer
         * Chitta: The storehouse of all memories and impressions of life
         3. Deep inner Self: The nonchanging pure consciousness, which has the quality of unity and witnesses the activity of the inner faculty. The deep inner Self is the source of all knowledge, intelligence, creativity, and all natural laws that govern existence.
According to Vedic science, the deep inner Self activates the inner faculty (working consciousness), which in turn activates the physical body. A feedback loop is provided by meditation, in which a conscious connection is made with the deep inner Self. This view of the human being correlates with the scientific view of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) in the body. On the cellular level, DNA creates and controls all activities in the body. Information from the DNA proceeds to ribonucleic acid (RNA), then to the amino acids, through which proteins are formed. A feedback loop to the DNA starts a new cycle to provide whatever is needed for the activities of the cell. In meditation, the feedback loop to the deep inner Self (the seat of knowledge, like DNA) provides inner peace and bliss, which removes the accumulated stresses of life and improves overall health.
Human beings routinely experience three states of consciousness:
         * Waking
         * Dreaming
         * Deep sleep.
When the inner faculty is in the waking state of consciousness, it is aware of the physical body and is involved with the outside objective world. In the dreaming state of consciousness, it is aware of the inner dream world, but is not aware of the physical body. In the deep sleep state of consciousness, the inner faculty is not functioning at all and is not aware of anything. In this state, dualities such as pleasure and pain, good and bad, etc., are not experienced. There is no experience of stress, anxiety, guilt, greed, envy, jealousy, anger, etc. The only experience in this state of unity is peace and bliss. This is why deep sleep or a “good night's sleep” feels so good.
The deep inner Self is always witnessing, or watching, the activity of the inner faculty. The experience of watching one's thoughts or daydreams occurs when the deep inner Self witnesses the activity of the waking state. During the dreaming state, this is experienced as watching one's dreams. During the deep sleep state, however, the inner faculty is asleep and not functioning on the level of duality. This is experienced as the peace and bliss of unity, and upon waking one feels refreshed from a good night's sleep.
There are various forms of meditation. The meditation process described herein attains the goal of meditation described in the ancient Vedic texts. This meditation process takes the mind from the outer realm of the objective world to the inner realm of the inner faculty (which includes the mind, intellect, ego, and Chitta - the storehouse of all memories and impressions of life), and finally goes beyond both the outer and inner realms to reach the deep inner Self. This deep inner Self is nonchanging pure consciousness, which witnesses the activity of the inner faculty. The inner faculty is the working consciousness, which is constantly changing. Going beyond the changing inner faculty to the nonchanging pure consciousness provides inner peace and bliss, which removes the accumulated stresses of life. This results in energizing the body and improving overall health.[7]
In deep sleep, the unity of the deep inner Self is experienced. In the process of meditation, one experiences the unity of the deep inner Self while aware and not sleeping. This experience of the peace and bliss of unity modifies the inner faculty. The properties of the deep inner Self begin to extend into the inner faculty, and since the deep inner Self is the source of all knowledge (which correlates with DNA on the physical level), the benefits of this process extend to all aspects of life - physical, mental, emotional, spiritual, etc.

Effects of Meditation
During the process of meditation, accumulated stresses are removed, energy is increased, and health is positively affected overall.[7] Research has confirmed a myriad of health benefits associated with the practice of meditation. These include stress reduction,[1,2,17,18,19,20] decreased anxiety,[1,17,19,21,22] decreased depression,[1,17,18,23,24] reduction in pain (both physical and psychological),[2,25,26] improved memory,[2,27] and increased efficiency.[12,28,29,30] Physiological benefits include reduced blood pressure,[2,31,32,33] heart rate,[2,16] lactate,[15,34] cortisol,[35,36,37] and epinephrine;[38] decreased metabolism,[15] breathing pattern,[39,40] oxygen utilization, and carbon dioxide elimination;[15,41] and increased melatonin,[42,43] dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S),[44,45] skin resistance,[15,16] and relative blood flow to the brain. Meditation increases regional cerebral blood flow in the frontal and anterior cingulate regions of the brain,[46,47,48,49,50] increases efficiency in the brain's executive attentional network,[12,28,29,30] and increases electroencephalogram (EEG) coherence.[13,14] A study on the effect of meditation on the executive attentional network found that meditators were faster on all tasks.[12] With aging, the brain cortical thickness (gray matter, which contains neurons) decreases, whereas meditation experience is associated with an increase in gray matter in the brain.[11,26,51,52]
Meditation decreases sympathetic overstimulation[53,54] and reduces cholesterol[55,56,57] and smoking.[58,59,60] A study investigating the effects of meditation on exercise-induced myocardial ischemia in patients with coronary artery disease found that meditation significantly increased exercise tolerance and maximal workload, and delayed the onset of ST-segment depression.[61] In a randomized, controlled trial of 201 African-American men and women with coronary heart disease, the effects of meditation versus health education were investigated. After 5 years, there was a 48% risk reduction in deaths, heart attacks, and strokes in the meditation group. There was also a significant drop in blood pressure and significant reduction in psychosocial stress factors.[19] Efficacy of meditation techniques has been found for epilepsy, symptoms of premenstrual syndrome, and menopausal symptoms.[1] Benefits have been demonstrated for mood and anxiety disorders,[1,17,21,22] autoimmune illness,[1,54] and emotional disturbances in neoplastic disease.[1,62]
Research has shown that a program of comprehensive lifestyle changes (including vegetarian diet and stress management - meditation and breathing exercises) improved health and modulated gene expression in prostate cancer patients who were not treated with surgery, radiation, or hormone therapy. This 3-month study showed changes in more than 500 genes: 48 genes were up-regulated and 453 genes were down-regulated. The down-regulated genes included disease-promoting genes with critical roles in tumorigenesis.[63] There are distinct gene expression changes induced not only by physical influences, but also by psychological, social, and cultural factors, as identified by the emerging field of psychosocial genomics.[64] Meditation and Yoga practices positively affect gene expression.[65,66]
Telomerase is the enzyme responsible for protecting and maintaining the length of telomeres, the protective caps at the end of chromosomes that promote chromosomal stability. Shorter telomeres are associated with accelerated aging and related diseases. Chronic stress reduces telomerase activity and accelerates telomere shortening and premature aging.[67,68,69] Meditation and Yoga practices improve telomerase activity and telomere length.[70,71] A study investigating the effect of meditation on the aging process showed that long-term meditators have a significantly younger biological age compared to short-term meditators and controls.[72] Meditation has resulted in a significant reduction in payments to physicians by a government health insurance agency. Over a period of 5 years, there was a cumulative reduction of 28% in high-cost meditators compared to high-cost nonmeditators.[73]

Conclusion
Meditation, as described in the ancient Vedic texts, is an exercise of consciousness that results in the expansion of consciousness beyond the day-to-day experience of duality. It is an experience of unity, which reduces stress and brings increased creativity and efficiency to the functioning of the inner faculty. This is an exercise that occurs without the mind directing the process. In physical exercise, the mind does not tell the muscles to get stronger; rather, the muscles are strengthened automatically by the exercise process. Likewise, in this exercise of consciousness, that is, meditation, the results are achieved automatically, not by controlling the mind or any other mental manipulation. The process of meditation goes beyond the mind to the deepest level of the inner Self.
Meditation is an umbrella term, which subsumes a huge number of diverse practices. It is still unclear how these practices can be classified in a reasonable way. Earlier proposals have struggled to do justice to the diversity of meditation techniques. To help in solving this issue, we used a novel bottom-up procedure to develop a comprehensive classification system for meditation techniques. In previous studies, we reduced 309 initially identified techniques to the 20 most popular ones. In the present study, 100 experienced meditators were asked to rate the similarity of the selected 20 techniques. Using multidimensional scaling, we found two orthogonal dimensions along which meditation techniques could be classified: activation and amount of body orientation. These dimensions emphasize the role of embodied cognition in meditation. Within these two dimensions, seven main clusters emerged: mindful observation, body-centered meditation, visual concentration, contemplation, affect-centered meditation, mantra meditation, and meditation with movement. We conclude there is no “meditation” as such, but there are rather different groups of techniques that might exert diverse effects. These groups call into question the common division into “focused attention” and “open-monitoring” practices. We propose a new embodied classification system and encourage researchers to evaluate this classification system through comparative studies.

Introduction
Meditation and mindfulness belong to two of the currently most popular and hyped research topics in psychology, psychiatry, medicine, and neuroscience (Van Dam et al., 2018). One issue that remains unsolved thus far, though, is providing a comprehensive theory of meditation (Sedlmeier et al., 2016). This is intensified by the fact that “meditation” is an umbrella term subsuming an extensive amount of diverse practices (Awasthi, 2013; Fox et al., 2016). Moreover, meditation is often used to describe both, the mental training technique employed by meditators as well as the resulting altered state of consciousness (Bond et al., 2009; Nash and Newberg, 2013). In this paper, we will mainly focus on the multiplicity of meditation techniques. To date, we have found no thorough overview of meditation techniques doing justice to the complexity and diversity of meditation practices found in various meditative traditions and schools. Additionally, there is no consensus on defining and demarcating meditation, left alone providing a truly encompassing classification system of meditation techniques. Our research aimed at filling this gap. By providing an copious list of commonly practiced meditation techniques (Matko et al., unpublished) and presenting the first empirically derived classification system of meditation in the present paper, we hope to contribute to an ongoing discussion and to an empirically grounded foundation for studying the effects of meditation, and, thus, working toward a future all-embracing theory of meditation.
Recently, researchers have begun to compare selected meditation techniques (Amihai and Kozhevnikov, 2014; May et al., 2014; Lumma et al., 2015; Fredrickson et al., 2017; Kropp and Sedlmeier, 2019; Trautwein et al., 2020) or proposed extended theoretical models and classification systems (Hölzel et al., 2011; Vago and Silbersweig, 2012; Nash and Newberg, 2013; Schmidt, 2014; Dahl et al., 2015; Lutz et al., 2015). Other researchers have elaborated on ancient theories of meditation tied to specific Hindu or Buddhist systems of thought (Lutz et al., 2007; Grabovac et al., 2011; Sedlmeier and Srinivas, 2016; Sedlmeier and Srinivas, in press). Whereas the latter approaches refer to specific combinations of meditation techniques, which are embedded in ethical and spiritual contexts, the former ones analyze and explain actually practiced meditation techniques, sometimes acknowledging but mostly bypassing ethical or spiritual context. Consequently, it seems hard to see through this variety of models and approaches, which reveal a lacking consensus among researchers.
Therefore, in an attempt to clarify and simplify these issues, we chose to develop a new classification system in a bottom-up way, relying on the judgments of experienced meditators. A similar approach has already been successfully employed in a study deducing a working definition of meditation by repeatedly asking a panel of seven experts in meditation research (Bond et al., 2009). In the present study, we requested a large sample of experienced meditators to compare a set of diverse, but commonly practiced meditation techniques according to the similarity of their expected general effects on practitioners. This approach was based on recent findings demonstrating how different meditation techniques yield different effects – phenomenologically, neuroscientifically, and psychologically. Hence, we concluded that this diversity of effects could provide a valuable means in detecting underlying dimensions that could help to structure the immense variety of meditation techniques. In the following, we will give a brief overview on the current state of the art.
Neuroscientific research has repeatedly shown differing brain activation and deactivation patterns during diverse meditative states following different meditative practices (Tomasino et al., 2014; Fox et al., 2016). Also, a growing body of research has found differential effects of specific types of meditation (Ospina et al., 2007; Sedlmeier et al., 2012, 2018; Goyal et al., 2014; Singer et al., 2016). So far, most research on the effects of meditation has been conducted without much theoretical foundation and has mainly been limited to four types of meditation: focused attention (mainly on the breath or the body), open monitoring, loving-kindness or compassion meditation, and mantra meditation (mostly Transcendental Meditation).
This limitation is probably due to the historical development of meditation research. While the 70’s saw considerable research efforts in examining the effects of Transcendental Meditation, the 90’s brought a huge interest into mindfulness meditation which keeps growing to the present (Schmidt, 2014). Meditation, though, is very diverse in itself, although it has been and is still largely being treated as a unitary construct. This is also reflected in the wide-spread use of “mindfulness meditation” as a synonym for meditation. A first attempt to differentiate meditation into “focused attention” (FA) and “open-monitoring” (OM) practices was brought forward by Lutz et al. (2008). Yet, as contemplative research kept expanding, more and more practices entered the field of interest. Whereas many models focus on describing the working mechanisms of mindfulness meditation (Grabovac et al., 2011; Hölzel et al., 2011; Tang et al., 2015; Grossenbacher and Quaglia, 2017), Vago and Silbersweig (2012) were among the first to propose diverse working mechanisms for three different styles of mindfulness meditation. These three styles of meditation are concentrative (FA), receptive (OM), and ethical enhancement (EE, e.g., loving-kindness or compassion) practices. Accordingly, now, “loving-kindness” and “compassion meditation” have been recognized as representatives of a new category as these practices entail elements of both, focused attention and open-monitoring styles of practice (Lippelt et al., 2014). More recent accounts have broadened the focus even further, as we will see in a moment.
Still, comparative studies have mainly focused on the above-mentioned four types of meditation, i.e., focused attention, open monitoring, loving kindness or compassion meditation, and mantra meditation. Studies empirically comparing some of these meditation techniques found differences in, e.g., dispositional mindfulness (Cebolla et al., 2017), creativity (Colzato et al., 2012), attention (Lee et al., 2012), affect (May et al., 2014), phenomenological experience (Przyrembel and Singer, 2018), or heartrate variability and perceived effort (Lumma et al., 2015). These differential effects highlight the possibility of categorizing meditation techniques into clusters of similar techniques according to their effects. Interestingly, another study (Amihai and Kozhevnikov, 2014) has shown that effects on the nervous system and cognitive performance depend more heavily on the tradition in which meditation is practiced than on the type of attentional system involved. Moreover, the framework in which certain meditation techniques are practiced seems to be of profound importance (Wachholtz and Pargament, 2005; Hunt et al., 2018; Trives, 2018). This rising complexity requires more complex models in explaining and classifying meditation.
Diverse meditation techniques have distinct effects. This finding has led to a few new proposals in classifying meditation including a greater diversity of meditation techniques from various backgrounds. Nash and Newberg (2013) chose to classify meditation practices into three domains of conjunct methods and states, i.e., cognitive, affective, and null domains. Another proposal (Dahl et al., 2015) categorizes meditation into three families, i.e., attentional, constructive, and deconstructive. Both proposals share certain commonalities. The cognitive domain and the attentional family both entail focused attention and open-monitoring practices. The affective domain and the constructive family both comprise techniques that aim at altering emotional responses, such as loving-kindness and compassion meditation. Dahl et al. (2015), however, expand the focus of this category and include Christian prayer and taking vows into their constructive family. The interpretation of the last category varies to some extent. While both approaches describe techniques and states aiming at dissolving the sense of self, closely related to “non-dual awareness” (Josipovic, 2010; Dahl et al., 2015) also include other “insight-oriented” practices, like the Buddhist Foundations of Mindfulness, Vipassana, Dzogchen, Koan, Mahamudra, and Muraqaba (a Sufi technique).
Yet, as reasonable as such considerations may be, these proposals have largely been derived top-down and, thus, might be limited by researchers’ personal expertise and experience. Consistent with this assumption, previous proposals omit several important and commonly practiced meditation techniques, especially from the Hindu context. Additionally, experienced meditators from the respective traditions might not agree with these classifications as the proposed clusters might be misguided attempts at throwing together “apples and oranges”.
Other approaches acknowledged these problems and devised phenomenological features or taxonomic keys to help researchers and practitioners describe what they are doing during meditation (Nash and Newberg, 2013; Schmidt, 2014; Lutz et al., 2015). Most taxonomies include questions on the object of meditation, the mental faculty or attentional mode employed, and the practical context of the practice (including questions on posture, guidance, setting, and breathing). They also touch on the effort, stability, and attitude or motivation behind the practice, or include questions on the axiological or traditional framework in which a practice is conducted. Furthermore, Lutz et al. (2015) emphasize cognitive and attentional factors, like degree of dereification (i.e., interpreting mental contents as mental processes rather than accurate depictions of reality), meta-awareness, and clarity. These taxonomies provide researchers and practitioners alike with valuable means of accurately describing their practice and allow to group or map meditation practices according to their phenomenology and contextuality. Still, the sheer number of taxonomies makes it difficult to detect commonalities amongst practices. Additionally, the diversity of meditation techniques makes it difficult to find an all-embracing definition of meditation and to properly differentiate meditation from other mind-body practices.
When people talk about meditation they often refer to someone sitting silently in a cross-legged position with closed eyes and searching for some inner silence or truth. This may be due to the historical development of meditation and meditation research in the West (see above) but cannot account for the immense variety of meditation practices found across different spiritual traditions. Interestingly, especially those approaches coming from our own Western Christian context, or from related Abrahamic traditions like Sufi mysticism and the Jewish Merkabah, have gotten less attention. Only now, there is an increasing interest into a more broad scientific exploration of meditation in its many forms, including rather atypical practices like Osho’s dynamic meditation (Bansal et al., 2016) or Kundalini Yoga (Peng et al., 2004). Yet, this broadening of the scope makes it even more difficult to find an overarching definition of what is actually meant by meditation. Some voices even discard the notion of finding a definition that “suits all” types of meditation (Schmidt, 2014). In the following, we will give some examples of the astonishing variety of definitions that have been brought up so far.
         * 1.
         * “The term meditation refers to a family of self-regulation practices that focus on training attention and awareness to bring mental processes under greater voluntary control and thereby foster general mental well-being and development and/or specific capacities such as calm, clarity, and concentration” (Walsh and Shapiro, 2006, p. 228).
         * 2.
         * “Meditation is an art of being serene and alert in the present moment, instead of constantly struggling to change or to become” (Deshmukh, 2006, p. 2239).
         * 3.
         * “Three main criteria have been defined as essential to any meditation practice: the use of a defined technique, logic relaxation (i.e., not intending to analyze, judge or expect), and a self-induced state/mode. Other criteria deemed important (by meditation experts) involve a state of psycho-physical relaxation, the use of a self-focus skill or anchor, the presence of a state of suspension of logical thought processes, a religious/spiritual/philosophical context, or a state of mental silence” (Bond et al., 2009, p. 135).
         * 4.
         * “A complex neural practice that induces changes in neurophysiology and neurochemistry of brain resulting in altered neurocognition and behavior in the practitioner” (Jaseja, 2009, p. 1).
         * 5.
         * “An exercise in which the individual turns attention or awareness to dwell upon a single object, concept, sound, image, or experience, with the intention of gaining greater spiritual or experiential and existential insight, or of achieving improved psychological well-being” (West, 2016, p. 4).
         * 6.
         * “A contemplative practice (e.g., meditation) is multi-generational, embedded in a community, has certain features which include an alteration of body and/or mind, and a certain kind of purpose or goal. There is a recipe (i.e., instructions) to achieve this goal, plus criteria for progress toward this goal which can be evaluated by evaluators from the community” (Dunne, 2018).
These six definitions are representative of opposing inclusion and exclusion criteria deemed important for labeling a practice meditation, or not. Some definitions are very specific (1, 3, 5), whereas others are rather broad (2, 4, 6). Specific definitions may be appropriate for investigating clear-cut research questions, they might, however, not account for the diversity of practices labeled “meditation”. Let’s consider the Sufi whirling technique (i.e., spinning around one’s own axis with arms spread out). This practice is generally considered a meditation technique aimed at “gaining greater spiritual or experiential insight” (5), it is thought to train awareness (1), and is a self-induced state of suspension of logical thought processes taking place within the context of a spiritual tradition (3). However, it does not necessarily involve a psycho-physiological relaxation (3), and does not necessarily focus on bringing mental processes under greater voluntary control (1), and might not be considered as dwelling upon a single object or experience (5).
On the other hand, very broad definitions could be very inclusive of diverse meditation techniques, but might broaden the scope too far by including practices generally not considered to be meditation techniques. This proves to be a tricky question, though. Can dancing, prayer, CrossFit or mindfully doing the dishes be considered meditation techniques or not? Where do we draw the line? According to definitions (2), (4), and (6) almost all the practices mentioned above would count as meditation. However, inducing “changes in neurophysiology and neurochemistry of brain resulting in altered neurocognition and behavior in the practitioner” (4) would also be true for experiences involving taking hallucinatory drugs or doing any kind of sports. As Ospina et al. (2007) point out, it might be “impossible to select components that might be considered universal or supplemental across practices” (p. 3). It might well be that the only thing all meditation practices have in common is the fact they are being called “meditation”.
This was the starting point for our research. We decided to approach the above-mentioned difficulties from a completely different perspective involving experienced meditators from diverse traditions in the process of gathering, selecting and grouping meditation techniques. We wanted to include as many different contexts, schools and traditions as possible. This bottom-up methodological approach differs fundamentally from any previous study, and stands in line with several researchers demanding a more rigorous investigation into the diversity of meditation techniques (Ospina et al., 2007; Travis and Shear, 2010). Our aim was to develop an empirical classification system of meditation techniques and to expand the scope of meditation practices under investigation. Thereby, we hope to inspire work toward developing one or more comprehensive theories of meditation.
As mentioned above, meditation techniques are often taught in a specific context, tradition or belief system. This context can influence the effects of meditation immensely (Amihai and Kozhevnikov, 2014; Hunt et al., 2018). Yet, little is known about the differential effects of specific meditation techniques, not to mention their interaction with context factors. For this reason, we chose to extrapolate basic meditation techniques common to many different contexts and traditions. This makes them easily accessible and understandable to many practitioners of diverse backgrounds and, thus, to researchers interested in the basic working mechanisms of meditation. Employing a bottom-up approach, we conducted two preparatory studies to extract diverse and recurring meditation techniques found in various spiritual traditions (Matko et al., unpublished). With this, we hope to provide a framework, which is independent of tradition-specific knowledge and easily applicable in any meditation (research) context.
Two preparatory studies were carried out to evaluate and deduce basic meditation techniques to be classified in the current study. In the first study (Matko et al., unpublished) we collected all meditation techniques we could find through literature search and by conducting guided interviews with 20 experienced meditators from diverse traditions such as Tibetan Buddhism, Theravada Buddhism, Zen Buddhism, Yoga, Hinduism, Tantra, Sri Chinmoy, Kundalini Yoga, Osho-Meditation, Christianity, Sufism, Brahma Kumaris and Qi Gong. Interviews focused on the central question “When you meditate, what exactly do you do?” The literature search included meditation manuals from different schools as well as research papers that included detailed descriptions of meditation practices (e.g., Dahl et al., 2015). This exhaustive search resulted in a list of 309 meditation practices that were reduced in several steps. Duplicates were removed, similar techniques were subsumed into one category, the level of abstraction was increased for techniques that were too specific, and techniques were excluded that were either too vague in their description (e.g., “catharsis”), or that were considered meditation practices of daily life rather than “formal practice” (e.g., mindfully doing the dishes). Technical terms (e.g., “chakra”) were replaced by more commonly used words (e.g., “energy center”) to make practices more easily comprehensible. This reduction led to a list of 50 basic meditation techniques.
The second preparatory study (Matko et al., unpublished) focused on exploring the prevalence, popularity, and comprehensiveness of our selection of 50 meditation techniques, and examined their underlying factor analytic structure. In a broad online survey, 637 experienced meditators from diverse meditation backgrounds provided data on how much experience they had with each of these 50 techniques. We found that all techniques were commonly used and could be grouped into seven factors. These factors represent groups of techniques that are commonly practiced together and correlate with the respective traditions they were derived from, but also span different traditions. In addition, we identified the 20 most popular meditation techniques widely practiced across many traditions (see section “Materials”, Table 1).

1These four features derived from Buddhist teachings which are called “brahmaviharas”. They refer to four “divine abidings” or “sublime states” which can be cultivated through meditation (Buswell and Lopez, 2014, p. 385). Cultivating these virtues, namely, loving kindness, compassion, empathetic joy, and equanimity, can help to counter “unwholesome states” like greed, ignorance and hatred, and may lead to living a more balanced life.
This final selection of 20 techniques formed the basis of the current study, which focused on examining the structure underlying these diverse techniques. These structural investigations were based on intuitive similarity ratings of general effects that might be expected when meditators engage in practicing these meditation techniques. We decided to focus on general effects, because we were interested in the most general intuitions associated with these techniques. To make similarity judgments not too difficult (and to avoid activating textbook-knowledge about meditation), we did not further discriminate phenomenological, psychological or behavioral effects in our investigation.
We chose to pursue a purely statistical approach in this venture rather than referring to pre-existing concepts based on traditions or theoretical approaches. On the one hand, we were interested in identifying dimensions along which these 20 techniques could be classified and differentiated. On the other hand, we took an interest in potential clusters of similar meditation techniques that could be identified within these dimensions. The dimensions and clusters should form the basis of a new, empirically derived classification system for meditation techniques.

Materials and methods
Procedure
The current study used multidimensional scaling (MDS) as a tool for uncovering latent dimensions of diverse meditation techniques (Borg et al., 2018). Moreover, MDS techniques enable a researcher to produce a typology or, in our case, clusters of similar techniques using the judgments of a diverse set of individuals who are blind to the purpose of the study. Hence, MDS-based typologies are less prone to researchers’ biases than typologies developed through other methods (Robinson and Bennett, 1995). Accordingly, we employed MDS in our study for both means, detecting implicit dimensions and deriving clusters of similar techniques. The great advantage of the present method is that we can use the intuitive knowledge of the experienced meditators without additional rationalizations that might occur if we asked them directly about underlying dimensions for classifying meditation techniques.
The procedures followed in this study and the results are discussed below. The data were collected in accordance with ethical guidelines pertaining to the use of human subjects.
We devised an online survey to judge the 20 most popular meditation techniques identified in the two above-mentioned preliminary studies (see section “Materials”, Table 1) according to their similarity as perceived by experienced meditators. Participants saw the upper half of a matrix listing all 20 meditation techniques horizontally and vertically. They were asked to rate the similarity of each technique on a scale from 0 (no similarity at all) to 10 (very high similarity). The instruction read “Please indicate for each of the following meditation techniques how similar it is to each other technique regarding its general effects.” The instruction was phrased deliberately in a very general way and left open to participants’ interpretation because we were interested in detecting general structures and intuitive typologies associated with these 20 meditation techniques. If participants did not know a specific technique enough to rate it, they could enter –1 as a missing value. To control for potential sequencing effects, the order of presentation for the 20 meditation techniques was determined randomly for a first questionnaire. A second questionnaire was constructed with the order reversed. Each participant was randomly assigned one of the two questionnaires.
Participants
The survey was sent to all participants of the second preparatory study mentioned above (Matko et al., unpublished) who had provided their e-mail addresses and consented to participate in further studies. A total of 102 experienced meditators completed the survey. Two participants were excluded because one did not provide sufficient data on his/her meditation routine, and one filled all answer fields with the same number. The final sample comprised 100 experienced meditators. The mean age was 52.90 years (SD = 10.78), the youngest participant being 26 years and the oldest 74 years old. 58.8% of the participants were female, and 93.0% were currently living in Germany.
Of all participants, 55.0% reported holding a university degree, 18.0% had completed higher education, 8.0% had completed their doctorate, and 11.0% had acquired a professional qualification. Regarding their occupation, 37.6% of participants were working as employees, 28.7% were self-employed, and 16.8% were retired.
Meditation Experience and Background
Participants had practiced meditation from 2 years up to 46 years, the mean meditation experience being 15.10 years (SD = 10.34). On average, they stated practicing meditation 6.97 times a week (SD = 5.48) for a mean of 31.90 min per session (SD = 22.60). 92.9% of all participants stated meditating regularly in the present, whereas 7.1% stated having meditated regularly in the past, but not in the present.
Participants were asked to select the tradition(s), the meditation techniques they practiced, were affiliated with. They reported practicing in the following traditions:
         * •
         * Zen (n = 35)
         * •
         * Theravada, Vipassana (n = 31)
         * •
         * Tibetan Buddhism (n = 29)
         * •
         * Yoga, Kundalini Yoga (n = 55)
         * •
         * Osho meditation (n = 10)
         * •
         * Other Hindu traditions, such as Vaishnavism, Sri Chinmoy, Sri Aurobindo, Mother Meera, Ramana Maharshi, Deepak Chopra, and Transcendental Meditation (n = 15)
         * •
         * Mindfulness, MBSR (n = 31)
         * •
         * Christianity (n = 10)
         * •
         * Sufism (n = 6)
         * •
         * Qigong, Tai Chi (n = 3)
         * •
         * Judaism, Merkabah (n = 1)
         * •
         * No Tradition, Free Meditation (n = 13)
         * •
         * Other (n = 3)
Several participants had been practicing in different spiritual traditions, therefore, the total number of allocated traditions (N = 242) surpasses the total number of participants (N = 100). 33.7% of all participants practiced in only one tradition, 48.5% practiced in two or three traditions, and the remaining 17.8% practiced in more than three traditions. These traditions could belong to a similar background, e.g., diverse Buddhist traditions, or could differ in their backgrounds.

Results
Multidimensional scaling can be applied to any similarity matrix. Thus, each participant’s ratings could serve as the basis for analysis. However, as an individual’s ratings can be very subjective or limited to his or her personal experience, we calculated the means of the similarity judgments across all participants. On the basis of the resulting similarity matrix, we performed a multidimensional scaling analysis using SPSS’s program PROXSCAL. Following recommendations by Borg et al. (2018, p. 78), we applied a multiple random starts configuration (n = 1000) and a stress convergence of 0.00001. Model fit was measured using the stress value, a measure depicting the aggregated representation errors of each data-distance pair (Borg et al., 2018, p. 29). Kruskal’s stress values for the one-, two-, and three-dimensional models were 0.207, 0.043, and 0.020, respectively. Adding the second and third dimensions reduced stress (by 0.164 and 0.023, respectively), suggesting an increasingly better fit with the data. The improvement from the two- to the three-dimensional model was negligible, though. Therefore, we opted for the two-dimensional model (Figure 1).

FIGURE 1
Overall multidimensional scaling (MDS) solution, based on average similarity judgments of N = 100 experienced meditators.
The statistical method of multidimensional scaling returns a dimensional output with potentially meaningful clusters, which are open to interpretation by the researcher. Thus, we thoroughly inspected Figure 1 and arrived at the following interpretation described below.
Dimension 1 has cultivating compassion and other brahmaviharas (see footnote 1), contemplating on a spiritual question, concentrating on a contradiction or paradox, and singing sutras or mantras on one extreme. At the other end are scanning the body, observing the abdomen or the nostrils while breathing, lying meditation, and manipulating the breath. Meditation techniques with a more abstract or conceptual focus received lower scores, while those with a higher amount of body-orientation received higher scores. Therefore, we decided to label this dimension “amount of body orientation”.
Dimension 2 has sitting in silence, concentrating on a contradiction or paradox, lying meditation, and observing thoughts or emotions at one end of the spectrum, while meditation with movement, walking and observing senses, and manipulating the breath are at the other end. Lower scores reflect a more passive, still and contemplative kind of meditation practice, while higher scores reflect more (bodily) active kinds of meditation practices. This dimension was labeled “activation”.
We identified seven clusters of meditation techniques by visual inspection (Figure 2). The biggest cluster includes five techniques that have a strong focus on observing the body, the breath or sensory perceptions, and was labeled “body-centered techniques” (middle right). It also includes concentrating on locations in the body or “energy centers”. Another cluster comprises practices that focus on mindfully observing oneself in stillness and was, thus, labeled “mindful observation”. It includes lying meditation, sitting in silence, and observing thoughts and emotions. These meditation techniques are relatively close to so-called “open-monitoring” techniques (see respective descriptions in Table 1). Manipulating the breath, walking and observing senses, and meditation with movement could be grouped into a broader cluster of “meditation with movement”.

FIGURE 2
Overall multidimensional scaling (MDS) solution with indicated clusters and labels.
Four smaller clusters were identified on the other side of the diagram, toward the more conceptual or object-oriented end. One cluster comprises concentrating on a contradiction or paradox and contemplating on a spiritual question and was labeled “contemplation”. The second cluster includes visualizations, and concentrating on an object or a visualized object, and was labeled “visual concentration”. The third cluster comprises opening oneself up to blessings, and cultivating compassion, loving-kindness, sympathetic joy, or equanimity, and can be seen as a cluster of “affect-centered techniques”. The forth of the smaller clusters includes repeating syllables, words or phrases, singing sutras or mantras, and meditation with sound, and was labeled “mantra meditation”.
These two dimensions, plus the seven clusters of meditation techniques, constitute our proposed new classification system of meditation techniques.
Differences Between Traditions
Results from one of the preliminary studies (Matko et al., unpublished) identified differences in usage and popularity of certain meditation techniques between meditators of two major traditions, i.e., Buddhist and Hindu meditators. Therefore, we decided to conduct another two multidimensional scaling analyses for these two subgroups. We wanted to see whether meditators from these two traditions have different conceptions about clusters and dimensions of basic meditation techniques.
Participants who stated practicing in one or more Buddhist traditions (i.e., Zen, Theravada, Vipassana, Mindfulness, or MBSR), but in no other tradition from another spiritual background, were allocated to the group of Buddhist meditators (n = 27). Participants practicing in one or more Hindu traditions (i.e., Yoga, Kundalini Yoga, Hindu traditions, or Osho), but in no other spiritual tradition, formed the group of Hindu meditators (n = 20). Participants of any other spiritual or mixed spiritual backgrounds were excluded from the following analyses.
In accordance with the results mentioned above, we selected two-dimensional models with Kruskal’s stress values of 0.054 (Buddhist), and 0.048 (Hindu), respectively. These values indicate an adequately good, but not perfect fit between model and data. Figure 3 shows the solution for Buddhist meditators, and Figure 4 for Hindu meditators (the original solution was mirrored along the X-axis to increase comparability between solutions), respectively.

FIGURE 4
Multidimensional scaling (MDS) solution for Hindu meditators (n = 20).
First, both figures indicate a high congruence between ratings. Both solutions, Buddhist and Hindu, bear similarity not only to each other, but also to the overall solution described above. Moreover, both solutions exhibit similar dimensions, namely “amount of body orientation” as Dimension 1, and “activation” as Dimension 2, and similar clusters of techniques. However, and importantly, some of the techniques have slightly shifted their position and/or affinity to the afore-mentioned clusters (printed in bold type).
The solution for Buddhist meditators shows basically the same cluster structure as the overall solution, with two small peculiarities. First, the technique walking and observing senses shifted from the “meditation with movement” to the “body-centered meditation” cluster. This appears reasonable when looking at Buddhist traditional practices where walking meditation is commonly practiced alternating with breathing meditation (Kornfield, 2009; Sedlmeier, 2016). Second, the distances increased between opening up to blessings and cultivating compassion, and visualizations and concentrating on an object, respectively. This may be indicative of an assumedly greater differentiation of these techniques in Buddhist meditators.
Looking at the solution of Hindu meditators, both dimensions can be replicated, again. Looking closer, certain shifts in location lead to changes in some clusters. Contrary to the Buddhist solution, opening oneself up to blessings and cultivating compassion remain in the same cluster. However, both techniques moved further away from the “visual concentration” cluster, and now appear to be closer to the cluster of “mantra meditation”. Second, the body scan has left the cluster of “body-centered techniques” and joined lying meditation and observing thoughts and emotions. This appears reasonable with regard to Hindu practice traditions, especially in the Yoga context where the body scan is commonly practiced in a supine position (Ott, 2013). Third, two techniques appear to form categories of their own as they are distant to and cannot be grouped with any of the other clusters. These two techniques are “sitting in silence” and “concentrating on energy centers or channeling”.
All in all, there is remarkable conformance between the original solution and both solutions from Buddhist and Hindu meditators, respectively. At the same time, both solutions reveal tradition-specific particularities that can easily be attributed to traditional frameworks and modes of practice. This gives further evidence to the general validity of the proposed classification system.

Discussion
The present study arrives at a novel classification system for meditation techniques and seems to be the first attempt to have been devised in an empirical and systematic bottom-up way. Drawing upon results from extensive preparatory studies (Matko et al., unpublished), we employed multidimensional scaling (MDS) to the similarity ratings of 100 experienced meditators for 20 well-known and diverse meditation techniques. Thus, our approach is unique not only in its methodology, but also in the variety of meditation techniques that were included in the analyses.
During the past years, the scope of scientific research has expanded continually to include a wider range of meditation practices (Nash and Newberg, 2013; Dahl et al., 2015). However, this expansion has made it even more difficult to find an overarching definition or top-down classification that could account for the diversity found in meditation practices (Schmidt, 2014). Therefore, we chose to rely on the judgments of experienced meditators, a method that has already been successfully employed by other researchers in the field trying to find demarcation criteria for meditation (Bond et al., 2009). This approach has the advantage of getting close-up practice-based insights from practitioners from a variety of spiritual backgrounds.
Based on our results, we propose a two-dimensional system of classifying meditation according to (1) the amount of body orientation in the technique, and (2) the level of activation in the technique. Furthermore, we propose seven main clusters of meditation techniques, namely: (1) Body-centered meditation, (2) mindful observation, (3) contemplation, (4) mantra meditation, (5) visual concentration, (6) affect-centered meditation, and (7) meditation with movement.
Taking a closer look at the dimensions and clusters, implicit assumptions of experienced meditators differ fundamentally from afore-mentioned theoretical proposals. Former proposals have focused on cognitive variables to describe and differentiate meditation techniques with the popular “focused attention” (FA) and “open monitoring” (OM) distinction (Lutz et al., 2008) leading the way. But also newer models (Nash and Newberg, 2013; Dahl et al., 2015) have attributed differences in techniques largely to diverse cognitive mechanisms or attentional modes at work. Thereby, the involvement of different cognitive mechanisms should result in differential effects. For instance, meditation practices from the attentional family (Dahl et al., 2015) should increase attention and decrease mind-wandering, whereas meditation practices from the constructive family might affect the regulation of emotion.
Meditation Is Inherently Embodied
Quite on the contrary, our MDS solution does not depict cognitive, but rather embodied dimensions. Both dimensions, amount of body orientation and level of activation, are closely related to bodily processes. They have been taken into account in previous descriptive or taxonomic systems (Nash and Newberg, 2013; Schmidt, 2014), but have not been considered as central dimensions, yet.
It seems that, according to experienced meditators, meditation is inherently somatic. This is in line with research on “embodied cognition” (Damasio, 2006; Varela et al., 2017). Damasio (2006, 2012) convincingly argues that past and present states of the body heavily influence the contents and processes in the brain and that body-based emotions and feelings shape our mind. Nowadays, there is growing consensus among researchers that cognition is shaped by both, top-down (descending pathways from the cerebral cortex) and bottom-up (ascending pathways from the periphery) processes (Clark, 1999; Thompson and Varela, 2001; Wilson, 2002; Barsalou, 2010; Winkielman et al., 2015). This view has also been recently discussed in the context of contemplative science and mindfulness research (Michalak et al., 2012; Kerr et al., 2013; Cebolla et al., 2016; Khoury et al., 2017).
Meditation places the focus of attention onto those ascending and descending inner processes, making them more salient in consciousness. Many, if not all, meditation practices emphasize directing attention to interoceptive and/or exteroceptive signals. Whether meditators observe all incoming (sensory or mental) stimuli, develop compassionate feelings for others, silently repeat a mantra, or explicitly focus on bodily mechanisms such as the breath: the body remains a constant companion in all their endeavors. Likewise, Buddhist teachings emphasize that body and mind are equally valid objects of meditation, and encourage practitioners to use awareness of the whole body as a somatic anchor for mindfulness, or, in other words, cultivate an embodied form of mindfulness (Anālayo, 2016). Thus, it appears shortsighted to define meditation based on purely cognitive or attentional dimensions. We suggest that all meditation techniques have a somatic component and meditation is inherently embodied. We ground these assumptions in the results of our empirical analyses.
It is surprising, though, that meditators implicitly classify meditation techniques on embodied dimensions, although we had requested them to judge the similarity of general effects of these techniques. We do not know whether participants judged techniques according to similar phenomenological experiences likely to occur during the practice of the specific technique or according to similar psychological outcomes following the prolonged practice of the technique. It might well be that they considered the one or the other, or both, or something completely different. But, we can probably assume that these diverse interpretations of the question were leveled out by agglomerating the judgments of 100 participants. Overall, it seems that similarity or dissimilarity of meditation techniques seems to be implicitly attributed to differences in the two above-mentioned embodied dimensions, i.e., level of activation and amount of body orientation.
Yet, one issue that should be looked at more closely in further research is whether similarity on these two dimensions corresponds to differences in actual effects, too. Future studies should evaluate whether meditation techniques judged high in one dimension, e.g., level of activation, lead to similar phenomenological experiences, neuroscientific signatures, and/or psychological and behavioral outcomes. They could also compare techniques judged high versus techniques judged low in one dimension and investigate whether there is a linear increase or decrease of specific effects along this dimension. A close-up examination of diverse techniques could reveal similar or dissimilar mechanisms and processes underlying the practice of these techniques and take into account individual variation between participants.
Expanding Focused Attention and Open Monitoring
The commonly made distinction between FA and OM practices could not be replicated in the present study, confirming previously voiced considerations (Amihai and Kozhevnikov, 2014). Also, looking at Buddhist practices, the same meditation objects can serve for concentrative (shamata) as well as insight (vipassana) meditation techniques (e.g., Pa Auk, 2003). Moreover, some commonly used techniques, such as the body scan might be arguably seen as a mixture of (sequentially moving) focused attention and open awareness. So, it might not come as such a surprise that both, OM and FA practices are displayed in our model in a far more differentiated way.
Still, it is easier to connect the cluster of “mindful observation” techniques with OM practices than to make connections to the FA concept. The mindful observation cluster includes three main practices in which the present-moment experience is approached with an open and receptive attitude (Bishop et al., 2004). These are sitting in silence, observing thoughts and emotions, and lying meditation. In contrast, FA practices are possibly the most difficult to locate in our model. Many studies used breathing meditation as a form of FA or “concentrative meditation” (Valentine and Sweet, 1999; Manna et al., 2010; Ainsworth et al., 2013; May et al., 2014). Mantra meditation has also often been considered a specific form of FA (Fox et al., 2016, p. 211). On the contrary, some researchers have emphasized a different mode (“automatic self-transcending”) being supposedly active in mantra meditation (Travis and Shear, 2010). In this form of practice, the repetition of the mantra becomes successively more subliminal until it fades away into silence. Looking at our MDS solution, breathing meditation and mantra meditation are very distant from each other, underlining differences in presumed effects and mechanisms at work in these two techniques. Therefore, it does not seem plausible to subsume them into the same category of FA meditation.
Furthermore, observing the breath might be considered concentrative for novice meditators, but might progress into a more passive and observational mode with growing experience, or even change back and forth from concentrative to receptive during the same meditation session. This would also be true for other practices clustered together in our solution as “body-centered meditation,” i.e., scanning or observing the body, and concentrating on a location in the body or on “energy centers”. The only identifiable cluster of techniques with a strong concentrative focus is the group of “visual concentration” techniques. Conversely, these have a very specific visual focus (concentrating on an object such as a picture or disk, or visualization techniques). Thus, they can be considered to be a very specific form of FA.
In conclusion, we would suggest that it might eventually be helpful to discard the rather unspecific category of FA meditation and replace it by the more specific categories presented in our empirically derived MDS solution. This notion needs further empirical investigation, though. Future experimental intervention studies should evaluate whether the alleged differences between clusters can be replicated in empirical findings. According to our model, meditation techniques that are closer to each other in the MDS solution should yield more similar effects than techniques which are further apart from each other.
We encourage researchers to evaluate this new classification system through comparative empirical studies. These studies could investigate short-term and long-term effects of each technique or cluster of techniques taking into account phenomenological, psychological, behavioral and neuroscientific aspects. They could also try to capture individual experiences with and reactions to these techniques. Single-case research designs (Barlow et al., 2009) seem to be a promising approach in capturing differential effects of diverse meditation techniques. They enable custom-tailored measurement and high-resolution recording of specific changes over time, also regarding individual differences in responses to meditation (Sedlmeier et al., 2016). Several authors have pointed out that individual differences might tremendously influence the effects of meditation (Hölzel et al., 2011; Lippelt et al., 2014; May et al., 2014). Also, the phenomenological experiences encountered during meditation depend heavily on individual factors, such as personality or learning history (Schmidt, 2014). This individual variation might be of particular interest in the context of investigating diverse meditation techniques, especially regarding person-technique-fit. Consequently, future studies should include measures of personality traits and carefully capture individual responses to different forms of meditation.
Limitations and Future Directions
We are well aware that our choice of practices might have been limited to the regional availability of meditation teachers and traditions. Still, the comprehensiveness of our selection was confirmed by a broad sample of experienced meditators in one of the preparatory studies (Matko et al., unpublished). This allowed us to deliberately choose the 20 most popular and commonly known techniques for the current study. Additionally, the MDS solutions of ratings of primarily Buddhist or Hindu meditators were astonishingly congruent with the overall solution, while, at the same time, revealing tradition-specific particularities. This shows how different traditional background knowledge can frame responses, even though the question we asked our participants was very general in nature. We might have received different answers if our question had been more specific, e.g., specifying phenomenological, psychological or behavioral effects. Yet, this was not the aim of the present study, which rather focused on detecting general structures and intuitive typologies. Future studies could evaluate more specific typologies of meditation.
One could argue that the 20 techniques, which were investigated in this study, were artificially constructed and taken out of context. Traditionally, meditation techniques are practiced in a specific order, in the framework of a specific tradition, or in combination with other practices. Observing the breath, e.g., is often combined with visualizations or with the repetition of a mantra. Conversely, little is known about the effects of combined meditation techniques compared to simple techniques. Therefore, it seems promising to investigate and compare both, simple and combined techniques, and see if there are, indeed, any additive or interactive effects.
The same is true for the sequence of practices and the specific framework or traditional context of practice. To date, there is a scarcity of studies into sequence or framework effects (Hölzel et al., 2011; Lippelt et al., 2014). Nevertheless, some studies have shown a greater perceived effort for participants who began their practice with loving-kindness meditation compared to beginning practice with breathing meditation or the body scan (Lumma et al., 2015; Kropp and Sedlmeier, 2019). Additionally, a specific traditional background or framework can tremendously influence the effects of meditation (Wachholtz and Pargament, 2005; Amihai and Kozhevnikov, 2014). However, these effects may be very complex, specifically regarding the manifold meditation traditions. For this reason, and as a first step of investigation, we chose to take out meditation techniques of their traditional context and evaluate their basic effects. This might help to effectively disentangle genuine effects of simple meditation techniques from the effects of their traditional context. Future studies could compare the effects of bare meditation techniques to a combined intervention of meditation practice and ethical or philosophical teachings.
Another argument could be that some of the 20 meditation techniques employed in this study are not simple techniques but already rather broad categories in themselves. For example, voluntarily manipulation of breath, visualizations, or meditation with movement are all conglomerates subsuming a lot of diverse techniques. This was our conscious choice in the interest of brevity. During our preparatory studies we came across a great variety of techniques (N = 309, list available on request) which had to be considerably shortened for the current study, for pragmatic reasons. In this way, we ensured that participants’ load during the similarity ratings remained manageable. At the same time, it allowed for comparisons to be fine-grained enough for our analysis, incorporating a great variety of meditation techniques. The remaining variety surpasses by far the range of meditation techniques examined in earlier studies.
Nonetheless, these broad categories of techniques should be eventually investigated in greater detail. For instance, manipulating the breath, also often referred to as “pranayama,” can take many forms. These can range from reducing the strength of breathing, to alternate nostril breathing with holding one’s breath, or even very rapid breathing (Ott, 2013; Ott and Epe, 2018). Investigations into different forms of “pranayama” or breathing techniques have already shown significant and differentiated effects on cardiovascular variables and stress (Peng et al., 2004; Conrad et al., 2007; Sengupta, 2012; Bhavanani et al., 2014). Still, some traditions regard breathing techniques as preparatory exercises rather than meditation techniques. For this reason, it would be interesting to further compare the effects of diverse breathing techniques, and, successively, compare them to other basic meditation techniques.
The other two broad categories mentioned above can be very diverse, too. Visualizations can focus on imagining light or fire at different body parts, imagining the body expanding in all directions, or merging with a visual representation of a deity (a typical Tibetan Buddhist practice, see, e.g., Amihai and Kozhevnikov, 2014). Meditation with movement includes techniques of Yoga, Qigong, Tai Chi, Osho meditation and other movement-based meditation traditions. These traditions are incredibly rich in the variety of techniques they offer (Ospina et al., 2007). Similar to sitting meditation techniques, the variety of meditation with movement seems limitless. A comprehensive overview of meditation techniques using movement is still missing in literature. Thus, it seems very worthwhile to take a closer look at these techniques and disentangle their specificities and working mechanisms. Subsequently, researchers could compare movement-based meditation techniques to other basic techniques.
In the long run, all of these efforts could contribute to establishing one or more theories of meditation. This endeavor is not only imperative for the future of scientific research into meditation (Sedlmeier et al., 2014; Sedlmeier et al., 2016), but also highly promising in understanding the phenomenon of meditation (or the phenomena of different kinds of meditations) more thoroughly. With the proposed classification system, we hope to have taken an important step toward achieving this goal and encourage future scientific investigation into this matter.

Conclusion
A broad range of diverse meditation techniques was effectively depicted in the novel classification system presented in this paper. This classification system is the first to be derived empirically by requesting experts’ evaluations. The dimensions depicted in our classification system shed new light on previous categorizations and shift the focus from cognitive to embodied variables of interest. We hope that our classification system will be useful for future studies and the development of one or more profound theories of meditation.
